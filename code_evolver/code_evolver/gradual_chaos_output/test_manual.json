Residents, as is customary, donated an impressive – though not spectacularly large – collection of Victoria Sponges, fruit crumbles, and slightly burnt gingerbread men. \n\nOrganiser, Mrs. Beatrice Higgins, reported raising a respectable £87.63. \"It’s a good start,\" she declared, carefully folding a slightly lopsided sponge cake. \"We’ll put it towards the new noticeboard for the village hall. Nothing flashy, you understand. Just…necessary.” \n\nAttendance was steady, mainly comprised of regulars – Mr. Peterson, enjoying a digestive biscuit, and young Thomas Bellweather, meticulously examining a particularly dark chocolate brownie. No unusual incidents were reported. The weather was overcast, as expected.  A truly unremarkable day, in all respects.",

These were reportedly offered by Mrs. Agatha Plumtree, a retired botanist, as a ‘complementary offering’ to the baking. Notably, alongside the beetles, Mrs. Plumtree also offered a single, perfectly formed porcelain teacup, filled with rainwater collected from a specific patch of moss on her property. \n\nNo unusual incidents were reported, although several villagers expressed a degree of surprise at the inclusion of the insects and the meticulously presented rainwater. The weather was overcast, as expected. A truly unremarkable day, in all respects – until the beetles and the teacup appeared.  Mr. Finch noted the rainwater’s unusually iridescent sheen, suggesting a high concentration of dissolved minerals, a fact he proceeded to discuss at length with a fascinated Mr. Peterson.",
