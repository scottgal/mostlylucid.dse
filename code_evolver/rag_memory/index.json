    "content": "**Problem Definition**\n\nWhat is my geolocation?\n\n**Inputs:**\n* None (assuming no additional context or user input)\n\n**Expected Outputs:**\n* Geolocation coordinates in the format of latitude and longitude (e.g., 37.7749\u00b0 N, 122.4194\u00b0 W)\n\n**Core Algorithm/Approach:**\nThe code will utilize an existing tool to determine the geolocation. Since the conversation_manager tool already provides context-aware conversations that optimize for response speed while maintaining accuracy, we will leverage its built-in functionality.\n\n**Requirements & Constraints**\n\n* **Functional Requirements:** Determine the user's geolocation\n* **Performance Constraints:** Minimize computation time and optimize for response speed\n* **Safety Limits:** None (assuming no specific limitations)\n* **Error Handling:** Return an error message if the tool fails to determine the geolocation or if invalid input is provided\n\n**Implementation Plan**\n\n1. Check if the conversation_manager tool is available: If yes, proceed with using its built-in functionality.\n2. Call the `get_geolocation()` function from the conversation_manager tool, passing no additional context or user input (assuming none).\n3. Return the geolocation coordinates as output.\n\n**Input/Output Interface**\n\n* **JSON Input:** None\n* **JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"geolocation\": {\n    \"latitude\": <latitude>,\n    \"longitude\": <longitude>\n  }\n}\n```\nExample Input -> Expected Output:\nNo input is required. The code will simply determine the user's geolocation and return it as JSON.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\n1. Test Case 1: Normal scenario with valid output\n\t* Input: None\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"geolocation\": {\n    \"latitude\": 37.7749,\n    \"longitude\": -122.4194\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Test Case 2: Error handling (tool not available)\n\t* Input: None\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Tool not available\"\n}\n```\n3. Test Case 3: Error handling (invalid input)\n\t* Input: Invalid data\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Invalid input\"\n}\n```\n\n**Tool Recommendation**\n\nSince the conversation_manager tool already provides built-in functionality for determining geolocation, we STRONGLY RECOMMEND using it via call_tool(). This approach minimizes custom code and leverages existing capabilities.\n\nBy following this specification, the code generator will create a simple yet effective implementation that utilizes an existing tool to determine the user's geolocation.",

Write clean, efficient, well-documented code following best practices.\n\nIMPORTANT: For content generation tasks (stories, articles, jokes), write Python code that DIRECTLY creates the content as a string in the main() function. DO NOT use call_tool().\n\nPriority: {priority}\nQuality expectation: {quality_level}\nSpeed requirement: {speed_requirement}\n\n\nPROMPT:\nYou are implementing code based on this DETAILED SPECIFICATION:\n\n**Problem Definition**\n\nWhat is my geolocation?\n\n**Inputs:**\n* None (assuming no additional context or user input)\n\n**Expected Outputs:**\n* Geolocation coordinates in the format of latitude and longitude (e.g., 37.7749\u00b0 N, 122.4194\u00b0 W)\n\n**Core Algorithm/Approach:**\nThe code will utilize an existing tool to determine the geolocation. Since the conversation_manager tool already provides context-aware conversations that optimize for response speed while maintaining accuracy, we will leverage its built-in functionality.\n\n**Requirements & Constraints**\n\n* **Functional Requirements:** Determine the user's geolocation\n* **Performance Constraints:** Minimize computation time and optimize for response speed\n* **Safety Limits:** None (assuming no specific limitations)\n* **Error Handling:** Return an error message if the tool fails to determine the geolocation or if invalid input is provided\n\n**Implementation Plan**\n\n1. Check if the conversation_manager tool is available: If yes, proceed with using its built-in functionality.\n2. Call the `get_geolocation()` function from the conversation_manager tool, passing no additional context or user input (assuming none).\n3. Return the geolocation coordinates as output.\n\n**Input/Output Interface**\n\n* **JSON Input:** None\n* **JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"geolocation\": {\n    \"latitude\": <latitude>,\n    \"longitude\": <longitude>\n  }\n}\n```\nExample Input -> Expected Output:\nNo input is required. The code will simply determine the user's geolocation and return it as JSON.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\n1. Test Case 1: Normal scenario with valid output\n\t* Input: None\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"geolocation\": {\n    \"latitude\": 37.7749,\n    \"longitude\": -122.4194\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Test Case 2: Error handling (tool not available)\n\t* Input: None\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Tool not available\"\n}\n```\n3. Test Case 3: Error handling (invalid input)\n\t* Input: Invalid data\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Invalid input\"\n}\n```\n\n**Tool Recommendation**\n\nSince the conversation_manager tool already provides built-in functionality for determining geolocation, we STRONGLY RECOMMEND using it via call_tool(). This approach minimizes custom code and leverages existing capabilities.\n\nBy following this specification, the code generator will create a simple yet effective implementation that utilizes an existing tool to determine the user's geolocation.\n\nTask: what is my geolocation\n\n[PREVIOUS CONVERSATION HISTORY (for reference only, NOT part of current task):\n- Manages intelligent conversations with multi-chat context memory, auto-summarization,\nand semantic search.

Provides co]\"       // Prompt field\n}\n\nUSAGE GUIDELINES:\n1. For simple computational tasks like \"add 10 and 20\", extract numbers from input_data[\"description\"]\n2. For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule - DO NOT implement logic directly\n    schedule = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a detailed project schedule for: {project_details}\")\n\n    # Return structured result\n    result = {\n        \"schedule\": schedule,\n        \"project_details\": project_details\n    }\n\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: call_tool() SIGNATURE**\n\nThe call_tool() function has this EXACT signature:\n```python\ndef call_tool(tool_name: str, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str\n```\n\n**CORRECT USAGE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Simple call with prompt\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write a joke about cats\")\n\n# \u2705 Call with formatted prompt\ntopic = \"dogs\"\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", f\"Write a poem about {topic}\")\n\n# \u2705 Translation with prompt\ntext = \"Hello\"\ntranslated = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to French: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 With keyword arguments (if tool supports them)\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write an article\", temperature=0.7, max_length=500)\n```\n\n**WRONG USAGE (WILL FAIL!):**\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - Passing dict as positional argument\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", {\"text\": \"hello\", \"lang\": \"fr\"})  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Too many positional arguments\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", \"param1\", \"param2\")  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Dict instead of kwargs\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"prompt\", {\"temperature\": 0.7})  # TypeError!\n```\n\n**CORRECT FIX FOR ABOVE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Build the prompt with the data\ntext = \"hello\"\nlang = \"fr\"\nresult = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to {lang}: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 Use kwargs, not dict\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write article\", temperature=0.7)\n```\n\n**KEY RULES:**\n1. call_tool() takes EXACTLY 2 positional arguments: (tool_name, prompt)\n2. Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4. The prompt should be a complete, descriptive string\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- The \"code\" field must contain ONLY executable Python code\n- NO markdown fences (no ```python)\n- NO explanations mixed with code\n- ALWAYS start with ALL required import statements:\n  * import json (REQUIRED)\n  * import sys (REQUIRED)\n  * from node_runtime import call_tool (REQUIRED if using content generation)\n- Must be immediately runnable without errors\n- For content generation: MUST use call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n- Verify all imports are present before generating code\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                      CRITICAL: OUTPUT IS MANDATORY!                        \u2551\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  EVERY SINGLE TOOL MUST PRINT OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER!          \u2551\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  Your generated code MUST include AT LEAST ONE print() statement that     \u2551\n\u2551  outputs JSON data.

Since the conversation_manager tool already provides context-aware conversations that optimize for response speed while maintaining accuracy, we will leverage its built-in functionality.\n\n**Requirements & Constraints**\n\n* **Functional Requirements:** Determine the user's geolocation\n* **Performance Constraints:** Minimize computation time and optimize for response speed\n* **Safety Limits:** None (assuming no specific limitations)\n* **Error Handling:** Return an error message if the tool fails to determine the geolocation or if invalid input is provided\n\n**Implementation Plan**\n\n1. Check if the conversation_manager tool is available: If yes, proceed with using its built-in functionality.\n2. Call the `get_geolocation()` function from the conversation_manager tool, passing no additional context or user input (assuming none).\n3. Return the geolocation coordinates as output.\n\n**Input/Output Interface**\n\n* **JSON Input:** None\n* **JSON Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"geolocation\": {\n    \"latitude\": <latitude>,\n    \"longitude\": <longitude>\n  }\n}\n```\nExample Input -> Expected Output:\nNo input is required. The code will simply determine the user's geolocation and return it as JSON.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\n1. Test Case 1: Normal scenario with valid output\n\t* Input: None\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"geolocation\": {\n    \"latitude\": 37.7749,\n    \"longitude\": -122.4194\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Test Case 2: Error handling (tool not available)\n\t* Input: None\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Tool not available\"\n}\n```\n3. Test Case 3: Error handling (invalid input)\n\t* Input: Invalid data\n\t* Expected Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"Invalid input\"\n}\n```\n\n**Tool Recommendation**\n\nSince the conversation_manager tool already provides built-in functionality for determining geolocation, we STRONGLY RECOMMEND using it via call_tool(). This approach minimizes custom code and leverages existing capabilities.\n\nBy following this specification, the code generator will create a simple yet effective implementation that utilizes an existing tool to determine the user's geolocation.\n\nTask: what is my geolocation\n\n[PREVIOUS CONVERSATION HISTORY (for reference only, NOT part of current task):\n- Manages intelligent conversations with multi-chat context memory, auto-summarization,\nand semantic search.

For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule -

Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4. The prompt should be a complete, descriptive string\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- The \"code\" field must contain ONLY executable Python code\n- NO markdown fences (no ```python)\n- NO explanations mixed with code\n- ALWAYS start with ALL required import statements:\n  * import json (REQUIRED)\n  * import sys (REQUIRED)\n  * from node_runtime import call_tool (REQUIRED if using content generation)\n- Must be immediately runnable without errors\n- For content generation: MUST use call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n- Verify all imports are present before generating code\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                      CRITICAL: OUTPUT IS MANDATORY!                        \u2551\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  EVERY SINGLE TOOL MUST PRINT OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER!          \u2551\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  Your generated code MUST include AT LEAST ONE print() statement that     \u2551\n\u2551  outputs JSON data.

    "content": "## DETAILED SPECIFICATION: Determine User Location\n\n**1. Problem Definition**\n\n*   **What needs to be solved?** The code needs to determine the user's current location based on their input.  For this initial iteration, we'll assume the user is providing a city name. The code will then return the latitude and longitude of that city.\n*   **Inputs:** A string representing a city name (e.g., \"London\", \"New York\", \"Paris\").\n*   **Expected Outputs:** A JSON object containing the latitude and longitude of the specified city.  The output should be in the format: `{\"latitude\": <float>, \"longitude\": <float>}`.\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n*   **Functional Requirements:**\n    *   The code must accurately retrieve the latitude and longitude for a given city name.\n    *   The code must handle invalid city names gracefully (return an error message).\n    *   The code should use a simple lookup table for city names.\n*   **Performance Constraints:**\n    *   Response time must be under 1 second.  This is a critical constraint.\n    *   Memory usage should be minimal (under 1MB).\n*   **Safety Limits:**\n    *   Maximum iterations: 1 (lookup is a direct lookup).\n    *   Input Size Limit: The city name string should not exceed 100 characters.\n*   **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    *   If the city name is not found in the lookup table, return a JSON object with \"error\": \"City not found\".\n    *   If the city name exceeds the maximum length, return a JSON object with \"error\": \"Invalid city name length\".\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n*   **Recommended Algorithm/Approach:** Direct dictionary lookup. This is the simplest and fastest approach for this task.\n*   **Data Structures:** A Python dictionary to store city names and their corresponding latitude/longitude coordinates.\n*   **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    *   `get_location(city_name)`:\n        *   Input: `city_name` (string)\n        *   Output: A JSON object (string) as described in the Expected Outputs.\n*   **LLM Tool Interaction:** None. This task is simple enough to be solved directly with Python code.\n*   **Execution Order:**\n    1.  Receive the `city_name` from stdin.\n    2.  Check if the `city_name` is in the lookup dictionary.\n    3.  If found, construct the JSON output with the latitude and longitude.\n    4.  If not found, construct the JSON output with the \"error\" message.\n    5.  Return the JSON output.\n\n**4. Input/Output Interface**\n\n*   **JSON Fields Read from stdin:**  None (The city name is assumed to be part of the prompt/input stream)\n*   **JSON Fields Written to stdout:**\n    *   `{\"latitude\": <float>, \"longitude\": <float>}` (if city found)\n    *   `{\"error\": \"City not found\"}` (if city not found)\n    *   `{\"error\": \"Invalid city name length\"}` (if city name length is invalid)\n\n*   **Example Input -> Expected Output**\n    *   Input: \"London\"\n        *   Output: `{\"latitude\": 51.5074, \"longitude\": -0.1278}`\n    *   Input: \"New York\"\n        *   Output: `{\"latitude\": 40.7128, \"longitude\": -74.0060}`\n    *   Input: \"Invalid City\"\n        *   Output: `{\"error\": \"City not found\"}`\n    *   Input: \"CityNameTooLong\"\n        *   Output: `{\"error\": \"Invalid city name length\"}`\n\n**5. Test Cases**\n\n| Test Case | Input (City Name) | Expected Output                               |\n| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| 1         | \"London\"          | `{\"latitude\": 51.5074, \"longitude\": -0.1278}`  |\n| 2         | \"New York\"        | `{\"latitude\": 40.7128, \"longitude\": -74.0060}` |\n| 3         | \"Paris\"           | `{\"latitude\": 48.8566, \"longitude\": 2.3522}`   |\n| 4         | \"Invalid City\"     | `{\"error\": \"City not found\"}`              |\n| 5         | \"CityNameTooLong\" | `{\"error\": \"Invalid city name length\"}`     |\n\n\n**6. Tool Recommendation**\n\n*   **NO existing tool matches the task.** This is a simple lookup.\n\nBased on the above, we will implement this directly in Python.  No custom tool is needed.\n",

    "content": "Okay, here's a DETAILED SPECIFICATION for code generation to determine a user's geolocation from their IP address.  I\u2019m prioritizing simplicity and leveraging existing tools where possible.\n\n**1. Problem Definition**\n\n*   **What needs to be solved?**  Determine the user's geolocation (city and country) based on their IP address.\n*   **Inputs:** A single IP address string.\n*   **Expected Outputs:** A JSON object containing the user\u2019s city and country. Example: `{\"city\": \"New York\", \"country\": \"USA\"}`\n*   **Core Algorithm/Approach:**  This task requires an IP geolocation API call.  We will utilize a simple API call to retrieve location data based on the IP address.\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n*   **Functional Requirements:**\n    *   The code must accurately retrieve location data from a reliable IP geolocation API.\n    *   The code must handle potential API errors gracefully (e.g., invalid API key, API unavailable).\n    *   The code must return a JSON object with the city and country.\n*   **Performance Constraints:**\n    *   Response time:  Ideally under 1 second.  (This is a soft constraint; prioritize accuracy).\n    *   Space Complexity: Minimal.  The code should not require large data structures.\n*   **Safety Limits:**\n    *   Maximum API calls:  Limit to 3 attempts per IP address to prevent abuse.\n    *   Input Size:  IP address string length will be limited to 45 characters (reasonable maximum).\n*   **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    *   If the API call fails (e.g., invalid API key, timeout), return a JSON object with an error message. Example: `{\"error\": \"Invalid API key\"}`.\n    *   If the API returns no location data (e.g., ambiguous IP address), return a JSON object with a message indicating this. Example: `{\"error\": \"No location data found\"}`.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n*   **Recommended Algorithm/Approach:**\n    1.  Call a suitable IP geolocation API. (We will use the `long_form_writer` tool to handle the API call.)\n    2.  Parse the API response.\n    3.  Construct the JSON output.\n*   **Data Structures:**\n    *   None explicitly needed beyond the JSON output format.\n*   **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    *   `get_geolocation(ip_address)`:\n        *   Input: `ip_address` (string)\n        *   Output: JSON object (as defined in the Output Interface).\n*   **LLM Tool Interaction:**\n    *   Call `long_form_writer` with a carefully constructed prompt to perform the API call. The prompt will include the IP address and instructions for parsing the response.\n*   **Execution Order:**\n    1.  Call `long_form_writer` with the IP address.\n    2.  Parse the JSON response from `long_form_writer`.\n    3.  Construct the JSON output.\n\n**4. Input/Output Interface**\n\n*   **JSON Input:**\n    *   `ip_address` (string): The IP address to resolve.\n*   **JSON Output:**\n    *   `city` (string): The city name.\n    *   `country` (string): The country name.\n    *   Example Input: `{\"ip_address\": \"8.8.8.8\"}`\n    *   Example Output: `{\"city\": \"Mountain View\", \"country\": \"USA\"}`\n\n**5. Test Cases**\n\n| Test Case ID | Input (ip_address) | Expected Output                               | Notes                               |\n|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| TC1          | \"8.8.8.8\"          | `{\"city\": \"Mountain View\", \"country\": \"USA\"}`   | Google DNS IP                     |\n| TC2          | \"1.1.1.1\"          | `{\"city\": \"Seattle\", \"country\": \"USA\"}`        | Cloudflare DNS IP                  |\n| TC3          | \"203.0.113.0\"       | `{\"city\": \"Unknown\", \"country\": \"Unknown\"}`    |  Reserved IP address, likely no valid location |\n| TC4          | \"invalid-ip\"       | `{\"error\": \"Invalid IP address\"}`           | Invalid IP format to test error handling |\n\n**6. Tool Recommendation (CRITICAL)**\n\n*   **RECOMMENDATION:**  Use the `long_form_writer` tool via `call_tool()`.\n*   **Reasoning:** The `long_form_writer` tool is designed for handling API calls and parsing complex responses.  It's the most appropriate tool for this task.  We'll construct a carefully crafted prompt for the `long_form_writer` to perform the IP geolocation API call.\n\n**Example call_tool() invocation (Conceptual - actual syntax will depend on the execution environment):**\n\n```\ncall_tool(tool=\"long_form_writer\", input={\"prompt\": \"Use the IP address 8.8.8.8 to find the city and country. Return the result in JSON format. If there is an error, return an error message in JSON format.\"})\n```\n\nThis specification provides a detailed roadmap for generating the code to determine a user's geolocation from their IP address, prioritizing simplicity and leveraging the available tools effectively.  It's designed to be followed precisely by the code generator.\n",

Includes proper error handling\n6. Follows the safety limits specified\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"the actual Python code as a string\",\n  \"description\": \"brief one-line description\",\n  \"tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]\n}\n\nMANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\n# CRITICAL: Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n# Only add if not using local mock (for testing)\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n\n# Now you can import from node_runtime (only if you need to call LLM tools):\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    # ALWAYS read input from stdin as JSON\n    input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Your logic here\n    # For content: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", input_data.get(\"description\"))\n    # For math: result = calculate(input_data.get(\"description\"))\n\n    # ALWAYS print result as JSON\n    print(json.dumps({{{{\"result\": result}}}}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL: The above example shows the REQUIRED path setup.\nEvery file that imports from node_runtime MUST include:\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n```\nBEFORE the import statement (the check allows using local mocks for testing)\n\n\nCRITICAL: PREFER SIMPLICITY!\n- If the task can be solved with simple code (if/else, dictionary lookup, basic math), DO THAT!\n- Examples:\n  * \"translate the word poop to french\" -> Simple dictionary: {\"poop\": \"merde\"}\n  * \"add 2 and 3\" -> Simple math: result = 2 + 3\n  * \"check if 7 is prime\" -> Simple function with loop\n- ONLY use call_tool() for tasks that REQUIRE LLM capabilities:\n  * Generating creative content (stories, poems, articles)\n  * Complex reasoning or analysis\n  * Tasks with many possible outputs that need intelligence\n\nCode requirements:\n- MUST use json.load(sys.stdin) to read input - NO sys.argv or command-line arguments!\n- For SIMPLE tasks (translations, math, lookups): Write direct code - NO call_tool()!\n- For CREATIVE tasks (stories, jokes, articles): Use call_tool() to invoke content generation LLM tools\n- Include proper error handling\n- **ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY**: MUST print output as JSON using print(json.dumps(...))\n  * EVERY tool MUST produce output - no exceptions!\n  * Even if there's an error, print the error as JSON: print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"...\"}))\n\n**INPUT DATA FORMAT**:\nThe code will receive input as a JSON object with these standard fields (interface):\n\n{\n  \"input\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",      // Main input field\n  \"task\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",        // Alternative task field\n  \"description\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\", // Description field (MOST COMMON)\n  \"query\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",       // Query field\n  \"topic\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",       // Topic field\n  \"prompt\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\"       // Prompt field\n}\n\nUSAGE GUIDELINES:\n1. For simple computational tasks like \"add 10 and 20\", extract numbers from input_data[\"description\"]\n2. For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule - DO NOT implement logic directly\n    schedule = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a detailed project schedule for: {project_details}\")\n\n    # Return structured result\n    result = {\n        \"schedule\": schedule,\n        \"project_details\": project_details\n    }\n\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: call_tool() SIGNATURE**\n\nThe call_tool() function has this EXACT signature:\n```python\ndef call_tool(tool_name: str, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str\n```\n\n**CORRECT USAGE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Simple call with prompt\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write a joke about cats\")\n\n# \u2705 Call with formatted prompt\ntopic = \"dogs\"\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", f\"Write a poem about {topic}\")\n\n# \u2705 Translation with prompt\ntext = \"Hello\"\ntranslated = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to French: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 With keyword arguments (if tool supports them)\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write an article\", temperature=0.7, max_length=500)\n```\n\n**WRONG USAGE (WILL FAIL!):**\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - Passing dict as positional argument\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", {\"text\": \"hello\", \"lang\": \"fr\"})  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Too many positional arguments\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", \"param1\", \"param2\")  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Dict instead of kwargs\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"prompt\", {\"temperature\": 0.7})  # TypeError!\n```\n\n**CORRECT FIX FOR ABOVE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Build the prompt with the data\ntext = \"hello\"\nlang = \"fr\"\nresult = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to {lang}: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 Use kwargs, not dict\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write article\", temperature=0.7)\n```\n\n**KEY RULES:**\n1. call_tool() takes EXACTLY 2 positional arguments: (tool_name, prompt)\n2. Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4. The prompt should be a complete, descriptive string\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- The \"code\" field must contain ONLY executable Python code\n- NO markdown fences (no ```python)\n- NO explanations mixed with code\n- ALWAYS start with ALL required import statements:\n  * import json (REQUIRED)\n  * import sys (REQUIRED)\n  * from node_runtime import call_tool (REQUIRED if using content generation)\n- Must be immediately runnable without errors\n- For content generation: MUST use call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n- Verify all imports are present before generating code\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                      CRITICAL: OUTPUT IS MANDATORY!                        \u2551\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  EVERY SINGLE TOOL MUST PRINT OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER!          \u2551\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  Your generated code MUST include AT LEAST ONE print() statement that     \u2551\n\u2551  outputs JSON data.

Problem Definition**\n\n* **What needs to be solved?**  The system needs to generate personalized email responses to customers inquiring about the status of their orders. The responses will be dynamically created based on the order's current status (e.g., \"Processing\", \"Shipped\", \"Delivered\").\n* **Inputs:** A JSON object containing order information. This object will include:\n    * `order_id` (string): Unique identifier for the order.\n    * `customer_name` (string): Customer's name.\n    * `order_status` (string): The current status of the order (e.g., \"Processing\", \"Shipped\", \"Delivered\", \"Cancelled\").\n* **Expected Output:** A JSON object containing the generated email response. This object will contain:\n    * `email_body` (string): The actual text of the email response.\n\n\n* **Core Algorithm/Approach:**  A simple lookup table (dictionary) will map order statuses to predefined response templates. The response template will be populated with the customer's name and order ID.\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n* **Functional Requirements:**\n    * The system must generate a unique email response for each order based on its status.\n    * The response must include the customer's name and order ID.\n    * The response must use a predefined template for each status.\n* **Performance Constraints:**\n    * Response generation must be extremely fast \u2013 ideally under 100ms. This is a critical requirement for a good user experience.\n    * Memory usage should be minimal \u2013 the primary concern is fast lookup, not large data storage.\n* **Safety Limits:**\n    * No iteration limits. The lookup table approach avoids iteration.\n    * Input size limit: Order information will be limited to reasonable sizes (e.g., max 200 characters for `customer_name`, `order_id` limited to alphanumeric characters).\n* **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    * If the `order_status` is not found in the lookup table, the system should return a default error message:  \u201cWe are experiencing technical difficulties.  Please contact customer support.\u201d\n\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n* **Recommended Algorithm/Approach:** Dictionary Lookup\n* **Data Structures:**\n    * `status_responses`:  A dictionary (hash map) where keys are order statuses (strings) and values are the corresponding email response templates (strings).\n* **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    * `generate_response(order_data)`:\n        * Input: `order_data` (JSON object \u2013 as defined in Input/Output Interface)\n        * Output: `email_response` (JSON object \u2013 as defined in Input/Output Interface)\n* **Execution Order:**\n    1.  Load the `status_responses` dictionary.\n    2.  Retrieve the email response template for the `order_data['order_status']` key.\n    3.  Populate the template with the customer\u2019s name and order ID.\n    4.  Return the populated email response.\n\n**4. Input/Output Interface**\n\n* **JSON Fields Read from stdin:**\n    * `order_id` (string)\n    * `customer_name` (string)\n    * `order_status` (string)\n* **JSON Fields Written to stdout:**\n    * `email_body` (string)\n\n* **Example Input:**\n```json\n{\n  \"order_id\": \"ORD-12345\",\n  \"customer_name\": \"Alice Smith\",\n  \"order_status\": \"Shipped\"\n}\n```\n* **Expected Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"email_body\": \"Dear Alice Smith,\\n\\nYour order (ORD-12345) has shipped! You can track it here: [Tracking Link]\\n\\nSincerely,\\nThe Customer Service Team\"\n}\n```\n\n**5. Test Cases**\n\n* **Test Case 1:**\n    * Input: `{\"order_id\": \"ORD-67890\", \"customer_name\": \"Bob Johnson\", \"order_status\": \"Processing\"}`\n    * Expected Output:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"email_body\": \"Dear Bob Johnson,\\n\\nYour order (ORD-67890) is currently being processed. We expect it to ship within 24-48 hours.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nThe Customer Service Team\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n* **Test Case 2:**\n    * Input: `{\"order_id\": \"ORD-13579\", \"customer_name\": \"Charlie Brown\", \"order_status\": \"Delivered\"}`\n    * Expected Output:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"email_body\": \"Dear Charlie Brown,\\n\\nYour order (ORD-13579) has been delivered!  Thank you for your order.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nThe Customer Service Team\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n* **Edge Case Test Case:**\n    * Input: `{\"order_id\": \"ORD-99999\", \"customer_name\": \"David Lee\", \"order_status\": \"Cancelled\"}`\n    * Expected Output:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"email_body\": \"Dear David Lee,\\n\\nWe are experiencing technical difficulties.  Please contact customer support.\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**6. Tool Recommendation**\n\n* **RECOMMENDATION:**  No existing tool matches this task. This is a straightforward lookup problem.  We can build a custom implementation directly.  No need to call `llm_fake_data_generator` or `buffer`.  This is the optimal solution.\n\n\nTask: **Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\n\nAvailable LLM Tools you can call:\n- api_content_router: Intelligent routing system that analyzes user requests and automatically routes them to the most appropriate public API tool.

Prevents unnecessary specialization by identifying the underlying generic pattern.\n- prompt_mutator: Mutates LLM tool prompts for specific use cases. Specializes general prompts instead of forcing one prompt to fit all scenarios. Integrates with overseer for intelligent mutation decisions.\n- proofreader: Proofreads technical content for grammar, style, consistency, and technical accuracy\n- questions_about_me: Answers questions about the current system (memory, CPU, GPU, OS, disk, etc.) by gathering platform information and providing natural language responses. Handles questions like 'what memory do you have?', 'is the GPU busy?', 'what OS am I running?', etc.\n- quick_feedback: Fast proofreading and quick feedback for text. Uses fast model for speed.\n- quick_translator: Direct translation for words and short phrases. Returns immediate results without code generation. For longer translations (paragraphs, documents), use NMT translator or full translation workflow instead.\n- rag_cluster_optimizer: Iterative self-optimization loop for artifact clusters. Explores variants, generates candidates, validates them through tests and benchmarks, and promotes fitter implementations while preserving lineage. The system learns patterns and converges toward high-fitness implementations over time.\n- security_auditor: Audits code for security vulnerabilities using the most capable model for thorough analysis\n- semantic_comparator: Decides if two prompts have the EXACT same meaning (100% match) or are similar enough for mutation (>50%). Used to prevent inappropriate workflow reuse for creative tasks.\n- seo_optimizer: Optimizes technical content for search engines, suggests keywords, meta descriptions, and structure improvements\n- signalr_connection_parser: Parses natural language requests to connect to SignalR hubs and converts them into proper connection configuration. Extracts hub URL, context/method name, and workflow generation settings from conversational input.\n- signalr_llmapi_management: Complete skill for interacting with LLMApi SignalR simulator. Supports context management (create, list, delete), stream control (start/stop), and SSE streaming of API data.\n- style_extraction_evaluator: Evaluates the quality and completeness of extracted style profiles. Assesses accuracy, coverage, and usefulness of style analysis results.\n- summarizer: Summarizes content concisely while capturing all key points. Uses base model for quality.\n- summarizer_fast: Quick content summarization with small, fast model.\n\nUse when:\n- User says \"quickly summarize\"\n- Speed is priority\n- Basic quality is acceptable\n- Content < 8k tokens\n\nModel: gemma2:2b (very fast, 8k context)\n\n- summarizer_large: High-quality summarization with large context window.\n\nUse when:\n- User says \"carefully summarize\" or \"thoroughly\"\n- Quality is critical\n- Content 32k-128k tokens\n- Complex documents\n- Books, research papers\n\nModel: mistral-nemo (large, 128k context)\n\n- summarizer_medium: Balanced summarization with medium-sized model.\n\nUse when:\n- Quality matters\n- Reasonable speed needed\n- Content 8k-32k tokens\n- Need comprehensive summary\n\nModel: llama3 (balanced, 32k context)\n\n- task_to_workflow_router: Analyzes streaming task data from SignalR hub and automatically generates appropriate workflow code. Routes tasks to correct workflow patterns based on task type (summarize, generate, translate). Creates executable Python workflows for training the system.\n- technical_writer: Writes comprehensive technical articles, tutorials, and blog posts on software development topics\n- translation_quality_checker: Fast quality check for translation output using gemma3_1b. Detects repeated characters, garbled text, encoding errors, and translation failures. MUST be used after nmt_translator to validate output quality.\n- workflow_documenter: Generates comprehensive 'How to Use' documentation for workflows by analyzing code, inputs, outputs, and purpose. Creates user-friendly guides for front-end generation and API consumption.\n\nFollow the specification EXACTLY. Generate a Python implementation that:\n1. Matches the problem definition and requirements\n2. Implements the recommended algorithm/approach\n3. Uses the specified input/output interface\n4. Handles all edge cases mentioned\n5. Includes proper error handling\n6. Follows the safety limits specified\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"the actual Python code as a string\",\n  \"description\": \"brief one-line description\",\n  \"tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]\n}\n\nMANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\n# CRITICAL: Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n# Only add if not using local mock (for testing)\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n\n# Now you can import from node_runtime (only if you need to call LLM tools):\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    # ALWAYS read input from stdin as JSON\n    input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Your logic here\n    # For content: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", input_data.get(\"description\"))\n    # For math: result = calculate(input_data.get(\"description\"))\n\n    # ALWAYS print result as JSON\n    print(json.dumps({{{{\"result\": result}}}}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL: The above example shows the REQUIRED path setup.\nEvery file that imports from node_runtime MUST include:\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n```\nBEFORE the import statement (the check allows using local mocks for testing)\n\n\nCRITICAL: PREFER SIMPLICITY!\n- If the task can be solved with simple code (if/else, dictionary lookup, basic math), DO THAT!\n- Examples:\n  * \"translate the word poop to french\" -> Simple dictionary: {\"poop\": \"merde\"}\n  * \"add 2 and 3\" -> Simple math: result = 2 + 3\n  * \"check if 7 is prime\" -> Simple function with loop\n- ONLY use call_tool() for tasks that REQUIRE LLM capabilities:\n  * Generating creative content (stories, poems, articles)\n  * Complex reasoning or analysis\n  * Tasks with many possible outputs that need intelligence\n\nCode requirements:\n- MUST use json.load(sys.stdin) to read input - NO sys.argv or command-line arguments!\n- For SIMPLE tasks (translations, math, lookups): Write direct code - NO call_tool()!\n- For CREATIVE tasks (stories, jokes, articles): Use call_tool() to invoke content generation LLM tools\n- Include proper error handling\n- **ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY**: MUST print output as JSON using print(json.dumps(...))\n  * EVERY tool MUST produce output - no exceptions!\n  * Even if there's an error, print the error as JSON: print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"...\"}))\n\n**INPUT DATA FORMAT**:\nThe code will receive input as a JSON object with these standard fields (interface):\n\n{\n  \"input\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",      // Main input field\n  \"task\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",        // Alternative task field\n  \"description\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\", // Description field (MOST COMMON)\n  \"query\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",       // Query field\n  \"topic\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\",       // Topic field\n  \"prompt\": \"**Task:** Automatically generate customer service responses for order status updates via email, utilizing a CRM system to pull order information and dynamically create personalized responses based on the status (e.g., \u201cShipped,\u201d \u201cProcessing,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d).\"       // Prompt field\n}\n\nUSAGE GUIDELINES:\n1. For simple computational tasks like \"add 10 and 20\", extract numbers from input_data[\"description\"]\n2. For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule -

Dict instead of kwargs\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"prompt\", {\"temperature\": 0.7})  # TypeError!\n```\n\n**CORRECT FIX FOR ABOVE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Build the prompt with the data\ntext = \"hello\"\nlang = \"fr\"\nresult = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to {lang}: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 Use kwargs, not dict\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write article\", temperature=0.7)\n```\n\n**KEY RULES:**\n1. call_tool() takes EXACTLY 2 positional arguments: (tool_name, prompt)\n2. Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4. The prompt should be a complete, descriptive string\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- The \"code\" field must contain ONLY executable Python code\n- NO markdown fences (no ```python)\n- NO explanations mixed with code\n- ALWAYS start with ALL required import statements:\n  * import json (REQUIRED)\n  * import sys (REQUIRED)\n  * from node_runtime import call_tool (REQUIRED if using content generation)\n- Must be immediately runnable without errors\n- For content generation: MUST use call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n- Verify all imports are present before generating code\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                      CRITICAL: OUTPUT IS MANDATORY!                        \u2551\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  EVERY SINGLE TOOL MUST PRINT OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER!          \u2551\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  Your generated code MUST include AT LEAST ONE print() statement that     \u2551\n\u2551  outputs JSON data.

    "description": "Detailed implementation specification for: Extract customer details and service activation information from the event log.",
    "content": "## Code Generation Specification: Extract Customer & Service Activation Data\n\n**1. Problem Definition**\n\n* **What:** Extract customer details (name, email, phone number) and service activation information (service type, activation date, device ID) from a text log file.\n* **Inputs:** A text file containing event log entries. Each entry is assumed to be a single line of text.\n* **Outputs:** A JSON array of objects, where each object represents a single customer activation event.  Each object will contain the following keys:\n    * `customer_name` (string)\n    * `customer_email` (string)\n    * `customer_phone` (string)\n    * `service_type` (string)\n    * `activation_date` (string - YYYY-MM-DD format)\n    * `device_id` (string)\n\n* **Core Algorithm:** The algorithm will parse each line of the input log, identify the relevant fields using simple string matching (regular expressions are overkill for this level of simplicity), and construct the output JSON object.\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n* **Functional Requirements:**\n    * The code must accurately extract the specified fields from the input log.\n    * The output JSON must conform to the specified structure and data types.\n    * The code must handle missing fields gracefully (assigning a default value, like \"N/A\").\n* **Performance Constraints:**\n    * Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of lines in the input log.  This is a linear scan.\n    * Space Complexity: O(m), where m is the number of extracted events.\n* **Safety Limits:**\n    * Maximum Input Log Size: 10MB.  (This can be adjusted if needed, but a limit is crucial).\n    * Maximum Number of Iterations: None (linear scan is inherently iterative but controlled).\n* **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    * Invalid Log Format: If a line cannot be parsed, log the error to stderr and skip to the next line.\n    * Missing Fields: Assign \"N/A\" to missing fields.\n    * Input File Not Found: Return an error message to stderr and exit with a non-zero exit code.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n* **Recommended Algorithm:** A simple iterative approach. Read the input file line by line. For each line, use string matching to extract the relevant data.\n* **Data Structures:**\n    * `customer_data`: A dictionary to store extracted customer data for a single event.\n* **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    * `extract_customer_data(line: str) -> dict`: Takes a log line as input and returns a dictionary containing the extracted customer data.\n    * `process_log_file(filepath: str) -> list[dict]`: Reads the log file, calls `extract_customer_data` for each line, and returns a list of extracted customer data dictionaries.\n* **LLM Tools:** None. This task doesn't require creative content generation.\n\n* **Execution Order:**\n    1. Read the log file.\n    2. Iterate through each line of the log file.\n    3. For each line, call `extract_customer_data`.\n    4. Collect the extracted data into a list of dictionaries.\n    5. Return the list of dictionaries.\n\n**4. Input/Output Interface**\n\n* **Input (JSON via stdin):**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"filepath\": \"path/to/log_file.txt\"\n    }\n    ```\n* **Output (JSON to stdout):**\n    ```json\n    [\n      {\n        \"customer_name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"customer_email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n        \"customer_phone\": \"555-123-4567\",\n        \"service_type\": \"Premium Streaming\",\n        \"activation_date\": \"2023-10-27\",\n        \"device_id\": \"device_001\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"customer_name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n        \"customer_email\": \"jane.smith@example.com\",\n        \"customer_phone\": \"555-987-6543\",\n        \"service_type\": \"Basic Streaming\",\n        \"activation_date\": \"2023-10-26\",\n        \"device_id\": \"device_002\"\n      }\n    ]\n    ```\n\n**5. Test Cases**\n\n| Test Case ID | Input (JSON) | Expected Output | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| TC_001 | `{ \"filepath\": \"test_log1.txt\" }` | `[{\"customer_name\": \"Alice\", \"customer_email\": \"alice@example.com\", \"customer_phone\": \"123-456-7890\", \"service_type\": \"Basic Streaming\", \"activation_date\": \"2023-10-27\", \"device_id\": \"device_001\"}]` | Simple log file with one event. |\n| TC_002 | `{ \"filepath\": \"test_log2.txt\" }` | `[{\"customer_name\": \"Bob\", \"customer_email\": \"bob@example.com\", \"customer_phone\": \"987-654-3210\", \"service_type\": \"Premium Streaming\", \"activation_date\": \"2023-10-28\", \"device_id\": \"device_002\"}]` | Log file with one event. |\n| TC_003 | `{ \"filepath\": \"empty_log.txt\" }` | `[]` | Log file is empty. |\n| TC_004 | `{ \"filepath\": \"missing_fields.txt\" }` | `[{\"customer_name\": \"Charlie\", \"activation_date\": \"2023-10-29\", \"device_id\": \"device_003\"}]` | Log file with a line missing email and phone number. |\n\n\n\n**6. Tool Recommendation**\n\n* **STRONGLY RECOMMEND:**  `load_document` (Tool: Load Document) -  This tool can be used to efficiently load the log file and handle potential file I/O issues.  It also provides metadata validation.\n\n* **Alternative (if load_document fails):**  Direct file reading with the `open()` function and string manipulation.  (This is the fallback option)\n",

Problem Definition**\n\n* **What needs to be solved?** This code will generate a customer profile data object based on a provided set of extracted information and assign a unique customer ID. The customer ID will be a sequential integer.\n* **Inputs:** A JSON object containing extracted customer data. This object will have the following fields (keys): `name`, `email`, `age`, `city`.\n* **Expected Output:** A JSON object containing the generated customer profile data. This object will have the following fields: `customer_id` (integer), `name` (string), `email` (string), `age` (integer), `city` (string).\n\n* **Core Algorithm/Approach:**  A simple mapping of input fields to the output fields, with a sequential customer ID generation.\n\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n* **Functional Requirements:**\n    * The code must correctly generate a customer profile object with all required fields.\n    * The `customer_id` must be a unique integer, starting from 1 and incrementing for each generated profile.\n    * Data types must be consistent with the input fields.\n* **Performance Constraints:**\n    * Time Complexity: O(1) - The generation process should be instantaneous.\n    * Space Complexity: O(1) - The code should use a fixed amount of memory regardless of the number of profiles generated.\n* **Safety Limits:**\n    * No input size limits.  Assume reasonable data types.\n    * No iterations.\n* **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    * If any required input field is missing, the output should be an empty object `{}`.\n\n\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n* **Recommended Algorithm/Approach:** Direct mapping of input fields to output fields with sequential ID generation.\n* **Data Structures:**\n    * No complex data structures are needed.\n* **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    * `generate_customer_profile(input_data)`:\n        * Input: `input_data` (JSON object)\n        * Output: JSON object representing the generated customer profile.\n* **Execution Order:**\n    1.

Matches the problem definition and requirements\n2. Implements the recommended algorithm/approach\n3. Uses the specified input/output interface\n4. Handles all edge cases mentioned\n5. Includes proper error handling\n6. Follows the safety limits specified\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"the actual Python code as a string\",\n  \"description\": \"brief one-line description\",\n  \"tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]\n}\n\nMANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\n# CRITICAL: Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n# Only add if not using local mock (for testing)\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n\n# Now you can import from node_runtime (only if you need to call LLM tools):\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    # ALWAYS read input from stdin as JSON\n    input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Your logic here\n    # For content: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", input_data.get(\"description\"))\n    # For math: result = calculate(input_data.get(\"description\"))\n\n    # ALWAYS print result as JSON\n    print(json.dumps({{{{\"result\": result}}}}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL: The above example shows the REQUIRED path setup.\nEvery file that imports from node_runtime MUST include:\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n```\nBEFORE the import statement (the check allows using local mocks for testing)\n\n\nCRITICAL: PREFER SIMPLICITY!\n- If the task can be solved with simple code (if/else, dictionary lookup, basic math), DO THAT!\n- Examples:\n  * \"translate the word poop to french\" -> Simple dictionary: {\"poop\": \"merde\"}\n  * \"add 2 and 3\" -> Simple math: result = 2 + 3\n  * \"check if 7 is prime\" -> Simple function with loop\n- ONLY use call_tool() for tasks that REQUIRE LLM capabilities:\n  * Generating creative content (stories, poems, articles)\n  * Complex reasoning or analysis\n  * Tasks with many possible outputs that need intelligence\n\nCode requirements:\n- MUST use json.load(sys.stdin) to read input - NO sys.argv or command-line arguments!\n- For SIMPLE tasks (translations, math, lookups): Write direct code - NO call_tool()!\n- For CREATIVE tasks (stories, jokes, articles): Use call_tool() to invoke content generation LLM tools\n- Include proper error handling\n- **ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY**: MUST print output as JSON using print(json.dumps(...))\n  * EVERY tool MUST produce output - no exceptions!\n  * Even if there's an error, print the error as JSON: print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"...\"}))\n\n**INPUT DATA FORMAT**:\nThe code will receive input as a JSON object with these standard fields (interface):\n\n{\n  \"input\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",      // Main input field\n  \"task\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",        // Alternative task field\n  \"description\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\", // Description field (MOST COMMON)\n  \"query\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",       // Query field\n  \"topic\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",       // Topic field\n  \"prompt\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\"       // Prompt field\n}\n\nUSAGE GUIDELINES:\n1. For simple computational tasks like \"add 10 and 20\", extract numbers from input_data[\"description\"]\n2. For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule - DO NOT implement logic directly\n    schedule = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a detailed project schedule for: {project_details}\")\n\n    # Return structured result\n    result = {\n        \"schedule\": schedule,\n        \"project_details\": project_details\n    }\n\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: call_tool() SIGNATURE**\n\nThe call_tool() function has this EXACT signature:\n```python\ndef call_tool(tool_name: str, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str\n```\n\n**CORRECT USAGE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Simple call with prompt\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write a joke about cats\")\n\n# \u2705 Call with formatted prompt\ntopic = \"dogs\"\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", f\"Write a poem about {topic}\")\n\n# \u2705 Translation with prompt\ntext = \"Hello\"\ntranslated = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to French: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 With keyword arguments (if tool supports them)\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write an article\", temperature=0.7, max_length=500)\n```\n\n**WRONG USAGE (WILL FAIL!):**\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - Passing dict as positional argument\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", {\"text\": \"hello\", \"lang\": \"fr\"})  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Too many positional arguments\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", \"param1\", \"param2\")  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Dict instead of kwargs\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"prompt\", {\"temperature\": 0.7})  # TypeError!\n```\n\n**CORRECT FIX FOR ABOVE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Build the prompt with the data\ntext = \"hello\"\nlang = \"fr\"\nresult = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to {lang}: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 Use kwargs, not dict\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write article\", temperature=0.7)\n```\n\n**KEY RULES:**\n1. call_tool() takes EXACTLY 2 positional arguments: (tool_name, prompt)\n2. Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4. The prompt should be a complete, descriptive string\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- The \"code\" field must contain ONLY executable Python code\n- NO markdown fences (no ```python)\n- NO explanations mixed with code\n- ALWAYS start with ALL required import statements:\n  * import json (REQUIRED)\n  * import sys (REQUIRED)\n  * from node_runtime import call_tool (REQUIRED if using content generation)\n- Must be immediately runnable without errors\n- For content generation: MUST use call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n- Verify all imports are present before generating code\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                      CRITICAL: OUTPUT IS MANDATORY!                        \u2551\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  EVERY SINGLE TOOL MUST PRINT OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER!          \u2551\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  Your generated code MUST include AT LEAST ONE print() statement that     \u2551\n\u2551  outputs JSON data.

Problem Definition**\n\n* **What needs to be solved?** This code will generate a customer profile data object based on a provided set of extracted information and assign a unique customer ID. The customer ID will be a sequential integer.\n* **Inputs:** A JSON object containing extracted customer data. This object will have the following fields (keys): `name`, `email`, `age`, `city`.\n* **Expected Output:** A JSON object containing the generated customer profile data. This object will have the following fields: `customer_id` (integer), `name` (string), `email` (string), `age` (integer), `city` (string).\n\n* **Core Algorithm/Approach:**  A simple mapping of input fields to the output fields, with a sequential customer ID generation.\n\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n* **Functional Requirements:**\n    * The code must correctly generate a customer profile object with all required fields.\n    * The `customer_id` must be a unique integer, starting from 1 and incrementing for each generated profile.\n    * Data types must be consistent with the input fields.\n* **Performance Constraints:**\n    * Time Complexity: O(1) - The generation process should be instantaneous.\n    * Space Complexity: O(1) - The code should use a fixed amount of memory regardless of the number of profiles generated.\n* **Safety Limits:**\n    * No input size limits.  Assume reasonable data types.\n    * No iterations.\n* **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    * If any required input field is missing, the output should be an empty object `{}`.\n\n\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n* **Recommended Algorithm/Approach:** Direct mapping of input fields to output fields with sequential ID generation.\n* **Data Structures:**\n    * No complex data structures are needed.\n* **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    * `generate_customer_profile(input_data)`:\n        * Input: `input_data` (JSON object)\n        * Output: JSON object representing the generated customer profile.\n* **Execution Order:**\n    1. Initialize `customer_id` to 1.\n    2. Create an empty customer profile object.\n    3. Copy input fields to the customer profile object.\n    4. Return the generated customer profile object.\n* **LLM Tool Recommendation:** None.  This task is simple enough to be solved with direct code.\n\n\n\n**4. Input/Output Interface**\n\n* **Input (JSON):**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Alice Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"alice.smith@example.com\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"city\": \"New York\"\n  }\n  ```\n* **Output (JSON):**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"customer_id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"Alice Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"alice.smith@example.com\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"city\": \"New York\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n**5. Test Cases**\n\n| Test Case ID | Input (JSON)                               | Expected Output (JSON)                     |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| TC01         | `{ \"name\": \"Bob Johnson\", \"email\": \"bob.johnson@example.com\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Los Angeles\" }` | `{ \"customer_id\": 1, \"name\": \"Bob Johnson\", \"email\": \"bob.johnson@example.com\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Los Angeles\" }` |\n| TC02         | `{ \"name\": \"Charlie Brown\", \"email\": \"charlie.brown@example.com\", \"age\": 10, \"city\": \"Chicago\" }` | `{ \"customer_id\": 1, \"name\": \"Charlie Brown\", \"email\": \"charlie.brown@example.com\", \"age\": 10, \"city\": \"Chicago\" }` |\n| TC03         | `{ \"name\": \"David Lee\", \"email\": \"david.lee@example.com\", \"age\": 40, \"city\": \"Houston\" }` | `{ \"customer_id\": 1, \"name\": \"David Lee\", \"email\": \"david.lee@example.com\", \"age\": 40, \"city\": \"Houston\" }` |\n| TC04         | `{}`                                      | `{}`                                         |  (Edge Case: Empty Input)\n\n\n\n**6.

Matches the problem definition and requirements\n2. Implements the recommended algorithm/approach\n3. Uses the specified input/output interface\n4. Handles all edge cases mentioned\n5. Includes proper error handling\n6. Follows the safety limits specified\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"the actual Python code as a string\",\n  \"description\": \"brief one-line description\",\n  \"tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]\n}\n\nMANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\n# CRITICAL: Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n# Only add if not using local mock (for testing)\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n\n# Now you can import from node_runtime (only if you need to call LLM tools):\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    # ALWAYS read input from stdin as JSON\n    input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Your logic here\n    # For content: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", input_data.get(\"description\"))\n    # For math: result = calculate(input_data.get(\"description\"))\n\n    # ALWAYS print result as JSON\n    print(json.dumps({{{{\"result\": result}}}}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL: The above example shows the REQUIRED path setup.\nEvery file that imports from node_runtime MUST include:\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n```\nBEFORE the import statement (the check allows using local mocks for testing)\n\n\nCRITICAL: PREFER SIMPLICITY!\n- If the task can be solved with simple code (if/else, dictionary lookup, basic math), DO THAT!\n- Examples:\n  * \"translate the word poop to french\" -> Simple dictionary: {\"poop\": \"merde\"}\n  * \"add 2 and 3\" -> Simple math: result = 2 + 3\n  * \"check if 7 is prime\" -> Simple function with loop\n- ONLY use call_tool() for tasks that REQUIRE LLM capabilities:\n  * Generating creative content (stories, poems, articles)\n  * Complex reasoning or analysis\n  * Tasks with many possible outputs that need intelligence\n\nCode requirements:\n- MUST use json.load(sys.stdin) to read input - NO sys.argv or command-line arguments!\n- For SIMPLE tasks (translations, math, lookups): Write direct code - NO call_tool()!\n- For CREATIVE tasks (stories, jokes, articles): Use call_tool() to invoke content generation LLM tools\n- Include proper error handling\n- **ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY**: MUST print output as JSON using print(json.dumps(...))\n  * EVERY tool MUST produce output - no exceptions!\n  * Even if there's an error, print the error as JSON: print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"...\"}))\n\n**INPUT DATA FORMAT**:\nThe code will receive input as a JSON object with these standard fields (interface):\n\n{\n  \"input\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",      // Main input field\n  \"task\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",        // Alternative task field\n  \"description\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\", // Description field (MOST COMMON)\n  \"query\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",       // Query field\n  \"topic\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\",       // Topic field\n  \"prompt\": \"Generate the customer profile data based on extracted information and assign a unique customer ID.\"       // Prompt field\n}\n\nUSAGE GUIDELINES:\n1. For simple computational tasks like \"add 10 and 20\", extract numbers from input_data[\"description\"]\n2. For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule - DO NOT implement logic directly\n    schedule = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a detailed project schedule for: {project_details}\")\n\n    # Return structured result\n    result = {\n        \"schedule\": schedule,\n        \"project_details\": project_details\n    }\n\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: call_tool() SIGNATURE**\n\nThe call_tool() function has this EXACT signature:\n```python\ndef call_tool(tool_name: str, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str\n```\n\n**CORRECT USAGE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Simple call with prompt\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write a joke about cats\")\n\n# \u2705 Call with formatted prompt\ntopic = \"dogs\"\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", f\"Write a poem about {topic}\")\n\n# \u2705 Translation with prompt\ntext = \"Hello\"\ntranslated = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to French: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 With keyword arguments (if tool supports them)\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write an article\", temperature=0.7, max_length=500)\n```\n\n**WRONG USAGE (WILL FAIL!):**\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - Passing dict as positional argument\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", {\"text\": \"hello\", \"lang\": \"fr\"})  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Too many positional arguments\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", \"param1\", \"param2\")  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Dict instead of kwargs\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"prompt\", {\"temperature\": 0.7})  # TypeError!\n```\n\n**CORRECT FIX FOR ABOVE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Build the prompt with the data\ntext = \"hello\"\nlang = \"fr\"\nresult = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to {lang}: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 Use kwargs, not dict\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write article\", temperature=0.7)\n```\n\n**KEY RULES:**\n1. call_tool() takes EXACTLY 2 positional arguments: (tool_name, prompt)\n2. Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4. The prompt should be a complete, descriptive string\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- The \"code\" field must contain ONLY executable Python code\n- NO markdown fences (no ```python)\n- NO explanations mixed with code\n- ALWAYS start with ALL required import statements:\n  * import json (REQUIRED)\n  * import sys (REQUIRED)\n  * from node_runtime import call_tool (REQUIRED if using content generation)\n- Must be immediately runnable without errors\n- For content generation: MUST use call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n- Verify all imports are present before generating code\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                      CRITICAL: OUTPUT IS MANDATORY!                        \u2551\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  EVERY SINGLE TOOL MUST PRINT OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER!          \u2551\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  Your generated code MUST include AT LEAST ONE print() statement that     \u2551\n\u2551  outputs JSON data.

    "content": "## Code Generation Specification: BBC Content Fetch & Summarization\n\n**1. Problem Definition**\n\n*   **Goal:**  Fetch the content from the BBC website (www.bbc.co.uk) and generate a concise summary of the text on the page.  The summary should be presented to the user.\n*   **Inputs:**  The URL of the BBC page to fetch.\n*   **Outputs:** A text string containing the summary of the BBC page content.\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n*   **Functional Requirements:**\n    *   The code must successfully fetch the HTML content from the provided URL.\n    *   The code must identify and extract the main text content from the HTML.  This will likely involve parsing the HTML and filtering out navigation, headers, footers, and other non-content elements.\n    *   The code must generate a summary of the extracted text.  A reasonable summary length (e.g., 1-3 sentences) should be used.\n    *   The code must format the summary into a human-readable string.\n*   **Performance Constraints:**\n    *   The entire process (fetching, parsing, summarization) must complete within 5 seconds. This is a strict time limit.\n    *   Memory usage should be minimized.\n*   **Safety Limits:**\n    *   Maximum URL length: 2000 characters.  Reject URLs exceeding this length.\n    *   Maximum HTML content length: 10MB.  Reject HTML content exceeding this limit to prevent excessive memory usage and potential denial-of-service.\n*   **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    *   If the URL is invalid, return an error message.\n    *   If fetching the URL fails, return an error message.\n    *   If parsing the HTML fails, return an error message.\n    *   If summarization fails, return an error message.\n    *   All error messages should be informative.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n*   **Recommended Algorithm/Approach:**\n    1.  Fetch the HTML content from the URL using a suitable HTTP request library.\n    2.  Parse the HTML content using a library like Beautiful Soup or lxml.\n    3.  Identify the main text content by selecting elements based on tags (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`) and potentially by removing elements based on CSS selectors or XPath expressions.\n    4.  Apply a summarization technique. A simple approach is to take the first few sentences of the extracted text.  For longer content, a more sophisticated summarization algorithm (if available as a tool) should be used.\n    5.  Format the summary into a string.\n*   **Data Structures:**\n    *   `URL` (string)\n    *   `HTMLContent` (string)\n    *   `Summary` (string)\n*   **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    *   `fetch_html(url: str) -> str`:  Fetches the HTML content from the given URL.\n    *   `parse_html(html: str) -> str`: Parses the HTML content and extracts the main text.\n    *   `summarize_text(text: str) -> str`: Generates a summary of the given text.\n    *   `format_summary(summary: str) -> str`: Formats the summary into a human-readable string.\n*   **Execution Order:**\n    1.  `fetch_html()`\n    2.  `parse_html()`\n    3.  `summarize_text()`\n    4.  `format_summary()`\n\n**4. Input/Output Interface**\n\n*   **Input (JSON):**\n    *   `url: str` (required): The URL of the BBC page to fetch.\n*   **Output (JSON):**\n    *   `summary: str` (required): The generated summary of the BBC page content.\n\n*   **Example Input:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67221364\"\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The BBC News report details the ongoing negotiations between the US and China regarding trade tensions, highlighting the key sticking points and potential implications for global markets.\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**5.

Tool Recommendation**\n\n*   **RECOMMENDATION:  LOAD DOCUMENT (load_document)**.  This tool can load the HTML content into a structured format suitable for parsing and summarization.  This is the most appropriate tool for this task, given the need to process and extract data from a webpage.  This approach allows for more robust handling of HTML structure and avoids direct manipulation of raw HTML strings.  The `load_document` tool can be used to load the HTML content into a suitable format for further processing.  After loading, the extracted text can be passed to a summarization tool.\n",

Matches the problem definition and requirements\n2. Implements the recommended algorithm/approach\n3. Uses the specified input/output interface\n4. Handles all edge cases mentioned\n5. Includes proper error handling\n6. Follows the safety limits specified\n\nYou MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:\n\n{\n  \"code\": \"the actual Python code as a string\",\n  \"description\": \"brief one-line description\",\n  \"tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]\n}\n\nMANDATORY CODE STRUCTURE:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\n# CRITICAL: Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n# Only add if not using local mock (for testing)\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n\n# Now you can import from node_runtime (only if you need to call LLM tools):\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    # ALWAYS read input from stdin as JSON\n    input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Your logic here\n    # For content: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", input_data.get(\"description\"))\n    # For math: result = calculate(input_data.get(\"description\"))\n\n    # ALWAYS print result as JSON\n    print(json.dumps({{{{\"result\": result}}}}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL: The above example shows the REQUIRED path setup.\nEvery file that imports from node_runtime MUST include:\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n```\nBEFORE the import statement (the check allows using local mocks for testing)\n\n\nCRITICAL: PREFER SIMPLICITY!\n- If the task can be solved with simple code (if/else, dictionary lookup, basic math), DO THAT!\n- Examples:\n  * \"translate the word poop to french\" -> Simple dictionary: {\"poop\": \"merde\"}\n  * \"add 2 and 3\" -> Simple math: result = 2 + 3\n  * \"check if 7 is prime\" -> Simple function with loop\n- ONLY use call_tool() for tasks that REQUIRE LLM capabilities:\n  * Generating creative content (stories, poems, articles)\n  * Complex reasoning or analysis\n  * Tasks with many possible outputs that need intelligence\n\nCode requirements:\n- MUST use json.load(sys.stdin) to read input - NO sys.argv or command-line arguments!\n- For SIMPLE tasks (translations, math, lookups): Write direct code - NO call_tool()!\n- For CREATIVE tasks (stories, jokes, articles): Use call_tool() to invoke content generation LLM tools\n- Include proper error handling\n- **ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY**: MUST print output as JSON using print(json.dumps(...))\n  * EVERY tool MUST produce output - no exceptions!\n  * Even if there's an error, print the error as JSON: print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"...\"}))\n\n**INPUT DATA FORMAT**:\nThe code will receive input as a JSON object with these standard fields (interface):\n\n{\n  \"input\": \"fetch the content from www.bbc.co.uk (or any other site) and sumamrize the text on

For simple computational tasks like \"add 10 and 20\", extract numbers from input_data[\"description\"]\n2. For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule - DO NOT implement logic directly\n    schedule = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a detailed project schedule for: {project_details}\")\n\n    # Return structured result\n    result = {\n        \"schedule\": schedule,\n        \"project_details\": project_details\n    }\n\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: call_tool() SIGNATURE**\n\nThe call_tool() function has this EXACT signature:\n```python\ndef call_tool(tool_name: str, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str\n```\n\n**CORRECT USAGE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Simple call with prompt\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write a joke about cats\")\n\n# \u2705 Call with formatted prompt\ntopic = \"dogs\"\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", f\"Write a poem about {topic}\")\n\n# \u2705 Translation with prompt\ntext = \"Hello\"\ntranslated = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to French: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 With keyword arguments (if tool supports them)\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write an article\", temperature=0.7, max_length=500)\n```\n\n**WRONG USAGE (WILL FAIL!):**\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - Passing dict as positional argument\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", {\"text\": \"hello\", \"lang\": \"fr\"})  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Too many positional arguments\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", \"param1\", \"param2\")  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Dict instead of kwargs\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"prompt\", {\"temperature\": 0.7})  # TypeError!\n```\n\n**CORRECT FIX FOR ABOVE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Build the prompt with the data\ntext = \"hello\"\nlang = \"fr\"\nresult = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to {lang}: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 Use kwargs, not dict\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write article\", temperature=0.7)\n```\n\n**KEY RULES:**\n1. call_tool() takes EXACTLY 2 positional arguments: (tool_name, prompt)\n2. Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4. The prompt should be a complete, descriptive string\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n- The \"code\" field must contain ONLY executable Python code\n- NO markdown fences (no ```python)\n- NO explanations mixed with code\n- ALWAYS start with ALL required import statements:\n  * import json (REQUIRED)\n  * import sys (REQUIRED)\n  * from node_runtime import call_tool (REQUIRED if using content generation)\n- Must be immediately runnable without errors\n- For content generation: MUST use call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n- Verify all imports are present before generating code\n\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                      CRITICAL: OUTPUT IS MANDATORY!                        \u2551\n\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2557\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  EVERY SINGLE TOOL MUST PRINT OUTPUT - NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER!          \u2551\n\u2551                                                                            \u2551\n\u2551  Your generated code MUST include AT LEAST ONE print() statement that     \u2551\n\u2551  outputs JSON data.

      "user_prompt": "You are implementing code based on this DETAILED SPECIFICATION:\n\n## Code Generation Specification: BBC Content Fetch & Summarization\n\n**1. Problem Definition**\n\n*   **Goal:**  Fetch the content from the BBC website (www.bbc.co.uk) and generate a concise summary of the text on the page.  The summary should be presented to the user.\n*   **Inputs:**  The URL of the BBC page to fetch.\n*   **Outputs:** A text string containing the summary of the BBC page content.\n\n**2. Requirements & Constraints**\n\n*   **Functional Requirements:**\n    *   The code must successfully fetch the HTML content from the provided URL.\n    *   The code must identify and extract the main text content from the HTML.  This will likely involve parsing the HTML and filtering out navigation, headers, footers, and other non-content elements.\n    *   The code must generate a summary of the extracted text.  A reasonable summary length (e.g., 1-3 sentences) should be used.\n    *   The code must format the summary into a human-readable string.\n*   **Performance Constraints:**\n    *   The entire process (fetching, parsing, summarization) must complete within 5 seconds. This is a strict time limit.\n    *   Memory usage should be minimized.\n*   **Safety Limits:**\n    *   Maximum URL length: 2000 characters.  Reject URLs exceeding this length.\n    *   Maximum HTML content length: 10MB.  Reject HTML content exceeding this limit to prevent excessive memory usage and potential denial-of-service.\n*   **Error Handling Requirements:**\n    *   If the URL is invalid, return an error message.\n    *   If fetching the URL fails, return an error message.\n    *   If parsing the HTML fails, return an error message.\n    *   If summarization fails, return an error message.\n    *   All error messages should be informative.\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\n\n*   **Recommended Algorithm/Approach:**\n    1.  Fetch the HTML content from the URL using a suitable HTTP request library.\n    2.  Parse the HTML content using a library like Beautiful Soup or lxml.\n    3.  Identify the main text content by selecting elements based on tags (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`) and potentially by removing elements based on CSS selectors or XPath expressions.\n    4.  Apply a summarization technique. A simple approach is to take the first few sentences of the extracted text.  For longer content, a more sophisticated summarization algorithm (if available as a tool) should be used.\n    5.  Format the summary into a string.\n*   **Data Structures:**\n    *   `URL` (string)\n    *   `HTMLContent` (string)\n    *   `Summary` (string)\n*   **Key Functions & Signatures:**\n    *   `fetch_html(url: str) -> str`:  Fetches the HTML content from the given URL.\n    *   `parse_html(html: str) -> str`: Parses the HTML content and extracts the main text.\n    *   `summarize_text(text: str) -> str`: Generates a summary of the given text.\n    *   `format_summary(summary: str) -> str`: Formats the summary into a human-readable string.\n*   **Execution Order:**\n    1.  `fetch_html()`\n    2.  `parse_html()`\n    3.  `summarize_text()`\n    4.  `format_summary()`\n\n**4. Input/Output Interface**\n\n*   **Input (JSON):**\n    *   `url: str` (required): The URL of the BBC page to fetch.\n*   **Output (JSON):**\n    *   `summary: str` (required): The generated summary of the BBC page content.\n\n*   **Example Input:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67221364\"\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"summary\": \"The BBC News report details the ongoing negotiations between the US and China regarding trade tensions, highlighting the key sticking points and potential implications for global markets.\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n**5. Test Cases**\n\n| Test Case ID | Input (URL)                                   | Expected Output (Summary)                                                                                                |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| TC1          | \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67221364\" |  \"The BBC News report details the ongoing negotiations between the US and China regarding trade tensions, highlighting the key sticking points and potential implications for global markets.\" |\n| TC2          | \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67221364\" |  \"The BBC News report details the ongoing negotiations between the US and China regarding trade tensions, highlighting the key sticking points and potential implications for global markets.\" |\n| TC3          | \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67221364\" |  \"The BBC News report details the ongoing negotiations between the US and China regarding trade tensions, highlighting the key sticking points and potential implications for global markets.\" |\n| TC4          | \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67221364\" |  \"The BBC News report details the ongoing negotiations between the US and China regarding trade tensions, highlighting the key sticking points and potential implications for global markets.\" |\n\n\n**6. Tool Recommendation**\n\n*   **RECOMMENDATION:  LOAD DOCUMENT (load_document)**.  This tool can load the HTML content into a structured format suitable for parsing and summarization.  This is the most appropriate tool for this task, given the need to process and extract data from a webpage.  This approach allows for more robust handling of HTML structure and avoids direct manipulation of raw HTML strings.  The `load_document` tool can be used to load the HTML content into a suitable format for further processing.  After loading, the extracted text can be passed to a summarization tool.\n\n\nTask: fetch the content from www.bbc.co.uk (or any other site) and sumamrize the text on the page then show it to me\n\n[PREVIOUS CONVERSATION HISTORY (for reference only, NOT part of current task):\n- tool interaction with python_syntax_validator: Tool Interaction: python_syntax_validator\n\nType: tool\n\nInput:\n{\"command\": \"python tools\\\\executable/python_syntax_validator.py nodes\\\\generate_the_customer_profile\\\\main.py\", \"source_file\": \"nodes\\\\ge\n- tool interaction with output_validator: Tool Interaction: output_validator\n\nType: tool\n\nInput:\n{\"command\": \"python tools\\\\executable/output_validator.py nodes\\\\generate_the_customer_profile\\\\main.py\", \"source_file\": \"nodes\\\\generate_the_cus\n- tool interaction with output_validator: Tool Interaction: output_validator\n\nType: tool\n\nInput:\n{\"command\": \"python tools\\\\executable/output_validator.py nodes\\\\generate_the_customer_profile\\\\main.py\", \"source_file\": \"nodes\\\\generate_the_cus\n- tool interaction with python_syntax_validator: Tool Interaction: python_syntax_validator\n\nType: tool\n\nInput:\n{\"command\": \"python tools\\\\executable/python_syntax_validator.py nodes\\\\generate_the_customer_profile\\\\main.py\", \"source_file\": \"nodes\\\\ge\n- what is my location from my ip?: User: what is my location from my ip?\nProcessed successfully in 251.95s]\n\nAvailable LLM Tools you can call:\n- api_content_router: Intelligent routing system that analyzes user requests and automatically routes them to the most appropriate public API tool.

__name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL: The above example shows the REQUIRED path setup.\nEvery file that imports from node_runtime MUST include:\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport sys\nif not (Path(__file__).parent / \"node_runtime.py\").exists():\n    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n```\nBEFORE the import statement (the check allows

poop to french\" -> Simple dictionary: {\"poop\": \"merde\"}\n  * \"add 2 and 3\" -> Simple math: result = 2 + 3\n  * \"check if 7 is prime\" -> Simple function with loop\n- ONLY use call_tool() for tasks that REQUIRE LLM capabilities:\n  * Generating creative content (stories, poems, articles)\n  * Complex reasoning or analysis\n  * Tasks with many possible outputs that need intelligence\n\nCode requirements:\n- MUST use json.load(sys.stdin) to read input - NO sys.argv or command-line arguments!\n- For SIMPLE tasks (translations, math, lookups): Write direct code - NO call_tool()!\n- For CREATIVE tasks (stories, jokes, articles): Use call_tool() to invoke content generation LLM tools\n- Include proper error handling\n- **ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY**: MUST print output as JSON using print(json.dumps(...))\n  * EVERY tool MUST produce output - no exceptions!\n  * Even if there's an error, print the error as JSON: print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"...\"}))\n\n**INPUT DATA

For simple computational tasks like \"add 10 and 20\", extract numbers from input_data[\"description\"]\n2. For ALL content generation tasks (stories, jokes, articles, poems, essays, creative writing), you MUST use call_tool() to invoke LLM tools\n   - NEVER generate hardcoded content (no hardcoded jokes, stories, or text)\n   - ALWAYS use: content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt_describing_what_to_generate)\n   - The system will handle invoking the appropriate LLM model\n3. For project management tasks (schedules, WBS, task lists, outlines), use call_tool() with existing tools:\n   - NEVER implement complex logic directly - ALWAYS delegate to tools\n   - Use: outline = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a schedule for: {project_details}\")\n   - Use: wbs = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a work breakdown structure for: {project_details}\")\n   - DO NOT create stub functions or placeholder implementations\n   - DO NOT use undefined tools - only use tools that exist in the system\n4. For complex data processing, use input_data[\"input\"] as the main data field\n5. ALWAYS include these standard imports at the top:\n   - import json\n   - import sys\n   - from pathlib import Path\n   - from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional (as needed for type hints)\n   - CRITICAL: If you need to use call_tool(), you MUST add the path setup BEFORE importing:\n     ```python\n     # Add code_evolver root to path BEFORE importing node_runtime\n     sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\n     from node_runtime import call_tool\n     ```\n     (Do NOT import call_tool if you don't use it)\n\n6. ALWAYS include type hints on functions:\n   - main() -> None (since it doesn't return, it prints)\n   - Helper functions should have parameter and return type hints\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     def calculate_result(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:\n         # Your logic here\n         return result\n\n     def main() -> None:\n         input_data: Dict[str, Any] = json.load(sys.stdin)\n         result: str = calculate_result(input_data)\n         print(json.dumps({{\"result\": result}}))\n     ```\n   - Type hints help catch errors early and make code more maintainable\n\nIMPORTANT - DEMO SAFETY:\nFor potentially infinite or resource-intensive tasks, include SENSIBLE LIMITS:\n- Fibonacci sequence: Calculate first 10-20 numbers only (not infinite)\n- Prime numbers: Find first 100 primes (not all primes)\n- Iterations: Limit to 1000 iterations max\n- File sizes: Limit to 10MB max\n- List lengths: Limit to 10,000 items max\n- Timeouts: Add timeout logic for long-running operations\n\nExample for Fibonacci:\n```python\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n    # SAFE: Limit to first 20 Fibonacci numbers\n    n = min(int(input_data.get(\"n\", 20)), 100)  # Cap at 100 max\n    result = calculate_fibonacci(n)\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": result}))\n```\n\nExample for content generation tasks (jokes, stories, articles, poems):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract user's request description\n    task_description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n\n    # Build a detailed prompt for the LLM based on the task\n    # Example: If task is \"tell a joke about cats\", prompt could be \"Write a funny joke about cats\"\n    prompt = f\"Generate content for: {task_description}\"\n\n    # CRITICAL: Always use call_tool() for content generation - NEVER hardcode content\n    content = call_tool(\"content_generator\", prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ALWAYS print output - this is NON-NEGOTIABLE!\n    # The output MUST be printed or the tool is considered broken!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": content}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:\n- The print(json.dumps(...)) statement is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS!\n- If you forget to print output, the tool will appear broken to users\n- ALWAYS include at least ONE print statement that outputs JSON with a \"result\" field\n\nExample for joke generation specifically:\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Get the topic from input, or extract it from description\n    topic = input_data.get(\"topic\", \"\")\n    if not topic:\n        # If no topic specified, use description or default\n        description = input_data.get(\"description\", \"\")\n        topic = description if description else \"general humor\"\n\n    # Build prompt for joke generation\n    joke_prompt = f\"Tell a funny joke about {topic}\"\n\n    # Call LLM tool to generate the joke (NEVER use hardcoded jokes!)\n    joke = call_tool(\"content_generator\", joke_prompt)\n\n    # ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: Print the output!\n    print(json.dumps({\"result\": joke}))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nExample for project management tasks (schedules, WBS, outlines):\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# CRITICAL: Add path setup BEFORE node_runtime import\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))\nfrom node_runtime import call_tool\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)\n\n    # Extract project details from any of the common input fields\n    project_details = input_data.get(\"project_details\",\n                      input_data.get(\"description\",\n                      input_data.get(\"prompt\", \"\")))\n\n    if not project_details:\n        print(json.dumps({\"error\": \"No project details provided\"}))\n        return\n\n    # CRITICAL: Use call_tool() to generate the schedule - DO NOT implement logic directly\n    schedule = call_tool(\"outline_generator\", f\"Create a detailed project schedule for: {project_details}\")\n\n    # Return structured result\n    result = {\n        \"schedule\": schedule,\n        \"project_details\": project_details\n    }\n\n    print(json.dumps(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: call_tool() SIGNATURE**\n\nThe call_tool() function has this EXACT signature:\n```python\ndef call_tool(tool_name: str, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str\n```\n\n**CORRECT USAGE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Simple call with prompt\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write a joke about cats\")\n\n# \u2705 Call with formatted prompt\ntopic = \"dogs\"\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", f\"Write a poem about {topic}\")\n\n# \u2705 Translation with prompt\ntext = \"Hello\"\ntranslated = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to French: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 With keyword arguments (if tool supports them)\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write an article\", temperature=0.7, max_length=500)\n```\n\n**WRONG USAGE (WILL FAIL!):**\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - Passing dict as positional argument\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", {\"text\": \"hello\", \"lang\": \"fr\"})  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Too many positional arguments\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"action\", \"param1\", \"param2\")  # TypeError!\n\n# \u274c WRONG - Dict instead of kwargs\nresult = call_tool(\"tool\", \"prompt\", {\"temperature\": 0.7})  # TypeError!\n```\n\n**CORRECT FIX FOR ABOVE:**\n```python\n# \u2705 Build the prompt with the data\ntext = \"hello\"\nlang = \"fr\"\nresult = call_tool(\"nmt_translator\", f\"Translate to {lang}: {text}\")\n\n# \u2705 Use kwargs, not dict\nresult = call_tool(\"content_generator\", \"Write article\", temperature=0.7)\n```\n\n**KEY RULES:**\n1. call_tool() takes EXACTLY 2 positional arguments: (tool_name, prompt)\n2. Additional parameters MUST be keyword arguments (**kwargs), NOT a dict\n3. Build complex prompts using f-strings, don't pass separate parameters\n4.
