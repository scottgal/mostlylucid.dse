# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – With a Twist

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, incidentally, claims to have briefly encountered a small, disgruntled dragon whilst collecting his newspaper.

Council members reviewed photographic evidence, noting the surface damage. Councillor Mildred Periwinkle remarked that the rain seemed unusually… purple, and suggested a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the drainage system might be in order. The consensus, after a lengthy debate involving a single, perfectly formed Victoria sponge (apparently used for calming tempers), was to unanimously approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies.

The cost of the work – patching and resurfacing – is estimated at £385. Funding will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget, which, according to minutes from 1887, was originally intended to fund the construction of a small, automated guillotine for unruly sheep. Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting. 

Additionally, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall – a surprising decision, given rumours circulating about her involvement with a clandestine society of competitive pigeon breeders. A small contingent of residents expressed concern regarding the changes to the recycling guidelines, and one gentleman, Mr. Horace Chumley, insisted that all cardboard was being systematically targeted by a particularly vicious swarm of Spanish Inquisition agents. Councillor Periwinkle assured everyone that the council was aware, and had requested a team of knights to patrol the streets, shouting “Ni!” at any suspicious activity.
