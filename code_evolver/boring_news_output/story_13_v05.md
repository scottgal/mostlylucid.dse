# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And Something Else Entirely

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation & A Peculiar Pigeon

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists. Apparently, a local flock of pigeons had taken to decorating the brambles with tiny, meticulously crafted origami swans – a development the council attributed to “unusual atmospheric currents.”

“It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints. We’ve requested a further assessment and a timeline for action, but no firm commitments have been made as yet. We did, however, hear a rumour that a delegation of Knights, all vehemently insisting on saying ‘Ni’ during discussions, were observing from the back row.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle are still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. A particularly zealous Ministry of Silly Walks inspector was present, briefly scrutinising Mr. Finch’s attempts to demonstrate a particularly vigorous step – he was, thankfully, swiftly escorted out by a bewildered Reverend.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. There was a brief, unsettling discussion about the potential impact on the local population of sentient, tax-collecting badgers - a local historian mentioned a forgotten Spanish Inquisition occurred in the area centuries ago, though this was quickly dismissed. The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities, and a strange note about the recent appearance of a deceased parrot in Mrs. Peterson’s pet shop, which was promptly attributed to “seasonal shedding.”
