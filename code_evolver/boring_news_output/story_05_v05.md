# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – No Major Decisions Made (With a Twist)

## Residents Attend Meeting in Little Puddleton, Concerns Raised About Route Efficiency

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, attended by a modest gathering of approximately fifteen residents – including, reportedly, a small delegation from the Society for the Protection of Remarkably Lifeless Parrots. The primary item on the agenda was a review of the current kerbside waste collection route, proposed by Councillor Beatrice Higgins. Councillor Higgins argued for a revised schedule to minimize disruption to residents’ access and to optimise collection times, citing anecdotal evidence of residents struggling to access their bins on certain days – a situation she likened, rather dramatically, to “a logistical hydra.”

Following a brief discussion, the council voted to commission a short survey from local waste management company, Green Solutions Ltd, to assess the current route's efficiency. The survey will focus on identifying areas of congestion and potential bottlenecks. Several residents voiced concerns regarding the potential impact of the changes, primarily regarding the timing of collections and the impact on access for elderly residents. One particularly vocal attendee, Mr. Silas Peabody, insisted the current system was "perfectly acceptable, considering the ongoing rumours of clandestine Spanish Inquisitions attempting to reclaim all the village’s discarded rhubarb.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming village fete, scheduled for July 15th, and a reminder to residents to register for the new recycling scheme, which is due to be implemented next month. The fete committee confirmed that the bake sale will be raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, and a raffle will be held – with prizes including a signed portrait of a dragon (a local initiative, apparently). No decisions were made regarding the planning application for a new garden shed on Mr. Harold Finch’s property, though Councillor Higgins noted that Mr. Finch had been observed practicing his Ministry of Silly Walks during the break. 

Finally, a brief, unsettling conversation ensued about the unusually high number of sightings of knights – dressed in surprisingly modern clothing – who consistently responded to questions with a firm “Ni.” It was politely dismissed.
