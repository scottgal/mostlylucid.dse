# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – With a Minor Incident

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, predictably dominated by a lengthy discussion regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds – a surprisingly astute observation, considering the local rumours about the resident flock of miniature, territorial dragons.

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members. Councillor Arthur Finch suggested a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage – a necessary precaution, he insisted, given the unsettling reports coming from the local pet shop; the dead parrots seemed to be exhibiting a peculiar, almost sentient, hostility. 

Several concerns were raised, including a brief, unsettling mention from Councillor Davies of a previous, unexplained Spanish Inquisition that had briefly swept through the village in 1488 – a detail he’d apparently unearthed whilst researching the village’s historical drainage system. The Environment Committee briefly discussed the possibility of deploying a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector to assess the structural integrity of the paving stones, although this was quickly dismissed. 

The meeting also included a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion, a task complicated by the persistent, and frankly baffling, presence of a travelling salesman offering “genuine Roman legionary sandals” – a detail mentioned almost casually during the bin collection update. 

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against. A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls, and a concerning rumour about a knight who insisted on punctuating every discussion with a firm “Ni.”

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details – and perhaps bring a small offering of beeswax for the local bees, just in case.
