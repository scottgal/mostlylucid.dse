# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” However, the proposal met with considerable resistance from several members of the public.

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot and suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender – a sentiment echoed, bizarrely, by a delegation representing the recently-formed Society for the Ethical Treatment of Garden Gnomes (they’d just finished a particularly harrowing week investigating a suspected Spanish Inquisition involving a prize-winning begonia). Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues,” a statement that prompted a brief, uncomfortable silence as a representative from the Ministry of Silly Walks conducted a surprise inspection of the hall’s ventilation system – apparently, drafts were deemed a “significant disruption to the temporal flow.”

Mr. Penhaligon also mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that he’d heard rumours of a family of dragons attempting to run for mayor, though this was dismissed by Councillor Higgins as “probably just old Mr. Fitzwilliam’s sherry.” Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies – a concern amplified by the fact that a single, perfectly preserved dead parrot had been discovered in the village pet shop, sparking speculation about its origins. 

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular – a fact noted by a local historian who claimed the sponge recipe was a direct descendant of one used by knights during the Battle of Agincourt (though this was, predictably, disputed).
