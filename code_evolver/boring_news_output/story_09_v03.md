# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Twist

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been having disturbing dreams involving a particularly judgmental badger – something about a miniature Spanish Inquisition, he believed.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks. A representative from Balfour Beatty was overheard muttering about the proper alignment of the cobblestones, something he insisted was crucial for avoiding temporal distortions.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – rumour has it the tin was originally blessed by a travelling troupe of knights who insisted on saying “Ni” at every council meeting to ward off bad luck.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. Councillor Higgins added, with a perfectly straight face, that she’d once seen a perfectly preserved, albeit deceased, parrot in the pet shop window – “a rather unsettling omen, I thought.” 

The meeting concluded with a brief discussion about the unusually high number of sightings of what was described as a “small, iridescent dragon” near the village duck pond.
