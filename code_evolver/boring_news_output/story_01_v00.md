# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch.  Council members reviewed photographic evidence and confirmed a small amount of surface damage caused by recent inclement weather.

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385.  Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget.  Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting.

Additionally, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall.  The council also reiterated the current recycling guidelines for the village, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection.  A small contingent of residents expressed concern regarding the changes.
