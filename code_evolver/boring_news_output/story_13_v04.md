# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And Other Matters

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation & The Case of the Missing Marmalade

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists. “It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints. Apparently, the Department of Temporal Anomalies is also investigating a possible localised time loop affecting roadworks – quite baffling.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle are still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. A particularly nervous vicar was overheard muttering about a recent sighting of a spectral goose near the rose bushes. 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. Witnesses reported a brief but alarming appearance of a miniature dragon during the discussion, briefly attempting to hoard the council’s paperwork. "It just wanted to catalogue the minutes," explained Clerk to the Council, Mr. Cecil Grimshaw. "Quite charming, really.”

There was also a rather heated debate about the potential for utilising the storage shed to house a collection of exceptionally grumpy parrots - a proposal strongly opposed by several residents citing concerns about “avian existentialism”. The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities, and a strangely solemn acknowledgement that the Parish Council had recently been subjected to a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection – apparently, Councillor Higgins' walk was deemed “remarkably efficient.”
