# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Dragon Sighting

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists – though several attendees noted a distinct shimmer in the late afternoon sunlight, possibly related to a reported sighting of a juvenile dragon attempting to establish a territory near the old mill. 

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget. Councillor Margaret Higgins, chair of the meeting, noted that this was one of several minor maintenance issues currently being addressed across the parish – including the disconcerting reappearance of a particularly judgmental collection of dead parrots at Mrs. Grimshaw’s pet shop.

Furthermore, a report was received from the village’s recycling officer, Mr. David Finch, detailing a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, and the council agreed to support this initiative. A brief, slightly panicked discussion arose concerning rumours of a revived Spanish Inquisition operating in the village square, though the investigation was ultimately deemed unnecessary by Councillor Davies, who insisted on observing a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the village’s street sweepers.

Finally, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund – a project complicated by the ongoing need to politely refuse the advances of a particularly persistent group of knights who insist on shouting “Ni” during every council meeting.  A single, perfectly formed goose egg was discovered in the raffle prize collection, adding to the general sense of bewildered curiosity.
