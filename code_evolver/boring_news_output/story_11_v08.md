# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – A Most Peculiar Affair

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated – predictably – by a lengthy discussion regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds. Witnesses reported a brief, unsettling shimmer around the roses just before the presentation, attributed by some to residual energy from a minor, unsolved Spanish Inquisition from 1492. 

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members. Councillor Arthur Finch suggested a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage – a suggestion that echoed a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the council chamber’s floor tiles just last week. 

Several concerns were raised, including a disconcerting rumour that local badger populations were developing a sophisticated understanding of Euclidean geometry, potentially influencing the rose’s positioning.  A brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule was followed by a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins were presented in an orderly fashion, a task complicated by the occasional sighting of a small, disgruntled dragon attempting to use the collection point as a personal landing strip. 

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against – a decision reportedly influenced by a particularly impassioned plea from a retired knight who insisted on adding "Ni" to every sentence during the debate.  A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls, including one promising a live demonstration of miniature, meticulously crafted dead parrots. 

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday, after a surprisingly detailed briefing from the local Ornithological Society on the migratory patterns of pigeons – a detail deemed vital for efficient route planning. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details.
