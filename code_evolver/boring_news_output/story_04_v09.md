# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Side of Bewilderment

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists – a sentiment echoed, somewhat surprisingly, by a local badger who’d been observed attempting a Ministry of Silly Walks across the road earlier that week.

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. The aim is to ensure the road is kept safe and tidy for all residents.” A brief, and entirely unrelated, discussion about the potential for a local dragon to run for mayor (apparently, a sizable portion of the electorate were swayed by his promises of fire safety) was quickly tabled.

Following the discussion, the council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project. Several attendees noted the unsettlingly realistic ceramic parrot displayed prominently in Mrs. Higgins’ pet shop window – a recent import from what some whispered was a lingering Spanish Inquisition.

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information.  A peculiar, almost hypnotic, chant about the importance of sorting plastics was briefly invoked by a visiting representative from the Department of Waste Management – allegedly linked to a series of baffling temporal anomalies detected near the old quarry. "It’s crucial," he insisted, "for the smooth running of the fourth dimension.”
