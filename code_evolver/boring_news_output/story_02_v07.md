# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And Something Else Entirely

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families – although a rumour persisted that a particularly disgruntled badger was present, demanding reparations for historical flooding. 

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted, though I heard they were briefly detained by a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector; apparently, their boots were deemed ‘excessively buoyant.’”

A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services confirmed they were investigating, adding, “We’ve encountered some… unusual geological formations. There’s a definite shimmer to the water. It reminds me of the Spanish Inquisition, though less… zealous.”

The council also briefly discussed the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste. Notably, several residents expressed concerns about the potential disruption to the local gnome population; they’d been reliably spotted attempting to sabotage the collection bins with miniature, intricately carved siege engines. 

Furthermore, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out. Councillor Bartholomew Finch, known for his dramatic pronouncements, reportedly shouted “Ni!” during the innings break, much to the amusement of the Upper Bampton supporters. 

Finally, a brief, unsettling discussion arose concerning the discovery of three deceased parrots in Mrs. Peterson’s pet shop – a matter currently under investigation by the Parish Council’s newly formed ‘Avian Anomalies’ sub-committee.
