# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And a Brief Encounter with a Grumpy Gnome

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families – and, curiously, a delegation representing the local chapter of the Society for the Preservation of Extinct Parrots. Witnesses reported one particularly vocal member, Mr. Silas Finch, vehemently arguing that the deceased cockatoos were "still watching, you know."

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem. Apparently, they’ve been dealing with a rather persistent gnome who insists on redirecting the water flow – something about a territorial dispute with a neighboring bog.”

A brief, and frankly bewildering, discussion followed regarding a report from the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors, who were apparently investigating a suspected case of excessive shuffling near the village green. No charges were made, though Constable Davies admitted to briefly considering deploying a miniature catapult to dislodge a particularly enthusiastic participant.

A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem and provide a preliminary report. The cost of any necessary repairs is currently unknown.  

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste. 

Finally, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out.  Local rumour suggests the Upper Bampton victory was aided by a brief, and strategically timed, deployment of a flock of trained pigeons.
