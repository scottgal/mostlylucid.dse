# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” However, the proposal met with considerable resistance from several members of the public. 

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot and suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender – a plant he’d once suspected was briefly used in a clandestine Ministry of Silly Walks inspection. He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that his great-uncle Bertram had been a surprisingly vocal advocate for the re-establishment of the Knights of the Round Table, though they mostly just said "Ni" at council meetings.

Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies. Apparently, a local beekeeper, Mr. Silas Bumble, was quietly monitoring the situation, convinced the roses were somehow linked to a particularly agitated swarm of bees – a theory that seemed suspiciously plausible considering the recent uptick in reported dragon sightings near the old quarry.

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues.” She then subtly adjusted her spectacles, a habit she’d developed after witnessing a small, impromptu Spanish Inquisition during the annual village fete (a baffling event that had left several prize-winning marrow entries mysteriously drained of their juices).

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular, though rumours persisted that the sponge recipe had been subtly altered by a visiting delegation from the Department of Temporal Anomalies.
