# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Peculiar Twist

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been having unsettling dreams involving synchronized swimming badgers.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting. A particularly observant member of the team, Mr. Bartholomew Higgins, noted a faint scent of sulfur emanating from the gravel - a detail he attributed to “seasonal variations” and a possible, though highly improbable, nest of miniature dragons.

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week.  The group’s treasurer, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, also confessed to spending an evening attempting to decipher ancient runes found inscribed on a discarded wheelbarrow – a project she believed held the key to unlocking the secrets of optimal biscuit dunking. 

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated.  Councillor Davies reminded everyone that last year’s bake sale had been briefly interrupted by a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection – a particularly memorable moment involving a lengthy debate about the appropriate footwear for judging Victoria sponges.
