## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Curious Twist

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink, a decision reportedly influenced by a rather insistent badger who’d been delivering cryptic pronouncements about “the cyclical nature of rose hues.”

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme,” a sentiment echoed, somewhat unnervingly, by a passing gentleman who claimed to be a descendant of the Knights Templar – though he insisted on punctuating every sentence with a resounding “Ni!”  Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends,” and “would create a more modern look,” a statement that felt particularly apt given the recent, inexplicable appearance of a miniature Spanish Inquisition investigating the village bakery for suspected heresy (regarding sourdough starters, apparently).

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday.  Interestingly, a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector was observed observing the proceedings, meticulously documenting the participants' gait, though he offered no discernible criticism.

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets.  A local pet shop reported a concerning influx of unusually lifelike, yet completely silent, dead parrots – a detail the vicar attributed to “the hand of God, or perhaps just a particularly ambitious taxidermist.”
