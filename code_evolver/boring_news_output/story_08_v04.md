# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” However, the proposal met with considerable resistance from several members of the public. 

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot, muttering something about “a miniature dragon infestation” being the real problem, and suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender. He also mentioned, quite seriously, that he’d once seen a particularly grumpy gnome attempting to sabotage a rose bush – a recurring issue in the village, apparently. Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies, adding that she’d recently been informed by a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector that excessive pollen levels were a “grave threat to national morale.”

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues,” before adding, almost as an afterthought, “We’ve consulted with a retired ornithologist who assured us the roses are perfectly safe – unless you count the occasional robin attempting a dramatic, if somewhat uncoordinated, landing.” 

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. There was a brief, and entirely unnecessary, debate about the potential for the roses to attract a visiting contingent of Spanish Inquisitors – a concern raised by Mr. Herbert Grimshaw, who claimed to have received a coded message from the Vatican. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular, though rumours persisted that the sponge was subtly infused with calming herbs – a precaution taken after a particularly unsettling incident involving a dead parrot in the local pet shop.
