# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – With a Slight Shift in Reality

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated by a lengthy, and frankly bewildering, discussion regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds – a factor that, according to Councillor Finch, reminded him vaguely of the migratory patterns of the Lesser Spotted Dragon (a surprisingly common concern at these meetings). The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members, although there was a palpable tension when Councillor Davies muttered something about ‘temporal anomalies’ and a brief, unsettling shimmer in the fluorescent lighting.

Several concerns were raised, primarily regarding the potential impact on the existing paving stones. Councillor Arthur Finch suggested a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage – a suggestion met with a raised eyebrow from Councillor Higgins, who claimed to have once witnessed a miniature Inquisition attempting to burn a particularly flamboyant petunia. The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion, though a local resident whispered about a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection due to a particularly enthusiastic collection strategy.

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against – largely due to their ongoing dispute over the placement of a recently discovered, remarkably lifelike, dead parrot in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop. A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls. 

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details, though rumour had it a delegation from the Department of Slightly Unusual Objects was also attending, “just to observe.”
