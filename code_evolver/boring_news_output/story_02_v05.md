# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – With a Twist

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families – though a surprisingly large contingent appeared to be examining the church’s collection of antique taxidermied badgers; Councillor Higgins suggested they were “investigating potential Ministry of Silly Walks inspections.”

Refreshments were sold raising approximately £347.12 for the village’s fundraising efforts.  A peculiar incident involving a lone, impeccably dressed gentleman attempting to barter a collection of vintage teaspoons for a "guarantee of no Spanish Inquisitions" was briefly noted before being politely dismissed.

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem and provide a preliminary report. Interestingly, the foreman informed us he’d previously consulted with a team of dragon experts regarding particularly stubborn watercourses – apparently, they favour a liberal application of powdered unicorn horn.”

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste. A small group of residents were overheard arguing vehemently about the potential for rogue knights to appear and shout “Ni!” during the collection process, a concern dismissed by the clerk as “purely hypothetical.”

Finally, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out.  It was rumoured, though denied by the captain, that the Upper Bampton team had employed a surprisingly effective tactic involving strategically placed, rather large, dead parrots for distraction.
