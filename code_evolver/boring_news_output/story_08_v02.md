# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert's Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” However, the proposal met with considerable resistance from several members of the public.

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot and suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender. He also muttered something about a particularly aggressive strain of aphids he’d encountered near the old Roman ruins – a surprisingly common concern, apparently. “They seem to have a fondness for disrupting the local ley lines,” he added, before discreetly adjusting his spectacles.

Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies. She also mentioned that she’d been receiving unsettling postcards from a man claiming to be a descendant of the Knights Templar, and suspected he was trying to establish a small, secretive Inquisition in the village – though the police assured her this was merely a rumour.

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues.” A brief, awkward silence followed as someone in the back loudly declared, "Ni!" – a reference, the council later deduced, to a recent Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the village’s drainage system. 

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A surprisingly well-preserved, though slightly bewildered, macaw was spotted perched atop the village hall, seemingly observing the proceedings. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular. The vicar was overheard delivering a particularly impassioned sermon about the importance of appreciating beauty, whilst a local historian was examining a recently unearthed collection of Victorian-era dead parrots, ostensibly for a display about the changing attitudes towards pets.
