# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – With a Peculiar Twist

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays in collections, particularly on Tuesdays – a day some suspected was particularly sensitive to the migratory patterns of the Lesser Spotted Gnome.

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton, voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change was partly influenced by a rather impassioned plea from Mr. Silas Finch, who claimed the previous schedule was “directly contributing to a localized temporal distortion.”

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event – a decision some felt was a deliberate attempt to appease the local Brownie troop, who were rumoured to be studying ancient divination rituals. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities. 

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week, although one worker admitted to occasionally spotting a flash of iridescent scales near the badger sett - a phenomenon the council politely attributed to “seasonal reflections.”  A fleeting reference was made to the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Mrs. Penelope Crabtree’s prize-winning pet ferret, a case that some whispered involved a secret society obsessed with collecting unusually shaped pebbles. 

The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th.
