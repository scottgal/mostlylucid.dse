# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – With a Side of Slightly Unhinged

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays in collections, particularly on Tuesdays – a recurring issue that some theorised was linked to a minor, localised dragon migration. 

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton (and a brief, unsettling sighting of a gentleman in a full suit of armour examining a skip), voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change was partly influenced by a recent Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the collection vehicles, deemed “unacceptably ponderous.”

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event – a donation rumoured to have originated from a clandestine baking competition between local villagers and a visiting Spanish Inquisition team. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities, including a surprisingly enthusiastic offer to teach the children the proper technique for communicating with dead parrots (a skill apparently in high demand).

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week – although a representative from the Department of Temporal Anomalies noted a slight shimmer in the tarmac, suggesting a possible minor breach in the space-time continuum. The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th, where they plan to debate the merits of installing a permanent, strategically-placed catapult for retrieving misplaced bins.
