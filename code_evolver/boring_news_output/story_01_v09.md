# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – And a Slight Dragon Sighting

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, incidentally, was observed arguing vehemently with a passing badger about the merits of parliamentary procedure.

Council members reviewed photographic evidence, noting the damage was “remarkably consistent with the migratory patterns of the Lesser Spotted Dragon,” a theory supported, somewhat surprisingly, by Mr. Davies, the local contractor. He’d been researching local folklore and, apparently, had a surprisingly detailed understanding of ancient rituals involving river crossings – a small contingent of residents quietly suggested this was linked to the ongoing investigations by the Ministry of Silly Walks into alleged temporal anomalies near the village weir.

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385. Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget – a budget that, rumour had it, was partially funded by donations from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Dead Parrots (they’d been having a particularly difficult time with the local pet shop).

Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting.  During this time, the council will be monitoring the situation closely, particularly concerning reports of a Spanish Inquisition attempting to determine the optimal angle for resurfacing – a request relayed by a visiting delegation from Seville.

Additionally, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall. The council also reiterated the current recycling guidelines for the village, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection – a task complicated, according to several residents, by the occasional appearance of a knight who consistently responded to requests for clarification with a firm “Ni.”
