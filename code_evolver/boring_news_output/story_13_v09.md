# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And Something Else Entirely

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation & The Case of the Missing Hedgehogs

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists – and, she subtly hinted, possibly attracting a particularly disgruntled colony of miniature, sentient dragons who’d taken an unhealthy interest in the local flora. 

“It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated, pausing to adjust her spectacles and mutter, “Honestly, you’d think they’d have learned their lesson after the incident with the prize-winning marrow.” She then noted that a brief, unsettling report had come in regarding a suspected Spanish Inquisition – involving a misplaced trowel and a rather indignant vicar – near the Old Mill.

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle were still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. A representative from the Ministry of Silly Walks was also present, conducting a discreet inspection of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities – ostensibly for “structural stability,” though rumours persisted about a potential reorganisation of the biscuit tin hierarchy. 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns – a concern that some suspected was linked to a long-standing dispute over a phantom water spirit. A dead parrot was briefly observed in the window of Mrs. Peterson’s pet shop, sparking a brief, impassioned debate about the ethics of taxidermy. The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities, punctuated by a single, resounding "Ni!" from Councillor Davies.
