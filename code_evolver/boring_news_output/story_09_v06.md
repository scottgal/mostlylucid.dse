# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Twist

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been having recurring dreams about sentient dandelions organizing a synchronized swimming routine.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue. Councillor Beatrice Higgins noted that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th – apparently involving a team from the Ministry of Silly Walks assessing the structural integrity of a particularly stubborn thistle. A schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted, costing an estimated £385, and would be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks.  Someone remarked that Balfour Beatty’s contracts were surprisingly often influenced by the annual Knights of the Round Table reunion, though the connection remained unproven.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remained unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop - rumour had it, a small delegation of Spanish Inquisitors were considering donating, though they were primarily interested in the quality of the bunting. 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. Councillor Davies, a staunch supporter of the “Dead Parrot Preservation Society,” argued passionately for the application, citing the garage's potential as a haven for ethically sourced, deceased avians. A particularly astute observer noted that the application’s architect had a disconcerting habit of saying "Ni" during discussions.
