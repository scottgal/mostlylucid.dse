# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And a Possible Unicorn

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families. Refreshments were sold raising approximately £347.12 for the village’s fundraising efforts – a surprisingly large sum, considering the rumours circulating about a travelling troupe of illusionists attempting to swap the vicar’s hat with a genuine griffin feather.

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem and provide a preliminary report. We’ve also received a concerning letter – apparently a local historian believes the church’s foundations are built upon the remnants of a particularly grumpy Roman legion. It’s all very… damp.”

A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services confirmed they’d brought along a small, highly agitated badger for observation – apparently, he's an expert in subterranean water flow.  “He seemed particularly interested in the stonework," he reported, "and kept muttering something about 'the sacred aquifer' and a possible uprising.”

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste. There were murmurs that the Ministry of Silly Walks were scheduled to conduct a surprise inspection of the recycling sorting process – a decision that seemed, frankly, unnecessary.

Finally, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out.  The captain of Little Puddleton was overheard saying, “At least the rain stopped before the knights arrived from Upper Bampton – they insisted on inspecting the pitch for signs of dragon activity.”
