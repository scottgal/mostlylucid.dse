# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Twist

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focused on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists – particularly those attempting to avoid the occasional, shimmering portal that appeared briefly near the old oak.

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget – a surprisingly large sum considering the ongoing investigations into a suspected Spanish Inquisition relating to misplaced garden gnomes. 

Councillor Margaret Higgins, chair of the meeting, noted that this was one of several minor maintenance issues currently being addressed across the parish, including a persistent rumour about a family of particularly aggressive badgers who insisted on wearing miniature knight’s helmets and frequently shouted “Ni!” during planning sessions.

Furthermore, a report was received from the village’s recycling officer, Mr. David Finch, detailing a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, and the council agreed to support this initiative – though some whispered that the leaflets were subtly designed to attract particularly observant crows. 

Finally, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund. A particularly disgruntled parrot, inexplicably found in Mrs. Beatrice Chumley’s prize-winning Victoria sponge, was quietly removed by a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector. It seemed a regular occurrence.
