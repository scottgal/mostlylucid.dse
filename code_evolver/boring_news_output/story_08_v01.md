# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design – And a Possible Dragon Sighting

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” A surprising number of attendees were also apparently discussing the recent reports of a small, iridescent dragon spotted near the duck pond – Councillor Peterson suggested a formal Ministry of Silly Walks inspection might be warranted.

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot, adding that “one simply *must* consider the cyclical nature of fungal growth, you know, like the Spanish Inquisitions – though thankfully, this isn’t quite so dramatic.” He suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender. Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies, lamenting that "it's a terrible time to be an allergy sufferer; I’ve been researching the possibility of a minor resurrection of the Templar Knights – purely for informational purposes, of course.”

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues,” adding somewhat cryptically, “We’re exploring the possibility of a localized weather modification project to ensure optimal bloom conditions.” 

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular, though rumours circulated that the sponge was being subtly imbued with a mild hallucinogenic property – a harmless experiment, according to the vicar.
