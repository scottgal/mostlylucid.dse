# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Twist

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists – and, he *strongly* suspected, a breeding ground for miniature, disgruntled dragons. Nobody seemed to dispute this.

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. The aim is to ensure the road is kept safe and tidy for all residents – and, ideally, to discourage any further attempts at summoning ancient forest spirits.”

Following the discussion, the council briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project. A representative from the Institute mentioned they were particularly keen on a Victoria sponge, “to appease the local pixies, you know.”

There was a brief, unsettling pause when Councillor Finch inquired about the status of the recent Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the village hall’s stairwell. Apparently, the inspector had been observed repeatedly attempting to execute the walk while reciting sonnets. 

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information. Mr. Penhaligon, leaving the meeting, was overheard muttering something about needing to invest in a small, highly reflective shield – “just in case.”
