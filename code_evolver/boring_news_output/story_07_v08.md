# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays, particularly on Tuesdays – reportedly due to a particularly active flock of pigeons engaging in a miniature, highly organized battle over discarded tea leaves. 

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton (and a brief, unsettling sighting of a man in a tweed suit attempting to sell bottled prophecies), voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change is expected to alleviate some pressure on the collection vehicles – and possibly deter any further attempts by the aforementioned prophecy merchant.

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities – though one gentleman insisted on demonstrating a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the bouncy castle. 

Councillor Higgins also mentioned a concerning report from the local ornithological society regarding a possible resurgence of the Spanish Inquisition, though the evidence was, admittedly, mostly circumstantial - a lot of paperwork.  A brief update was given on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week, although a single surveyor was overheard muttering about “temporal anomalies” and “the proper alignment of the runes.” 

The meeting concluded with a brief mention of a local resident’s claim that his pet badger was running for mayor, and a reminder that the next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th.  “Don’t forget your ‘Ni’s’,” Councillor Higgins added cryptically.
