## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Side of Minor Anomalies

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. A small delegation from the Ministry of Silly Walks were present, conducting a routine inspection of the council chamber’s ventilation system – apparently, excessive giggling was a potential hazard.

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme” and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also noted, somewhat cryptically, that his great-uncle Bartholomew had once been briefly involved in a minor Spanish Inquisition – a fact he occasionally brought up during particularly tense discussions. 

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” She also mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that a local artisan was attempting to train a flock of pigeons to deliver council notices – a venture deemed “potentially disruptive” by Mr. Finch. 

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday. A local pet shop had recently displayed a collection of deceased parrots, a development that caused some consternation amongst the older councillors, particularly Mr. Finch, who insisted they represented a “spiritual void.”

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets. A rumour persists that Upper Crumpington’s victory was partially due to a misplaced dragon, briefly participating in the match before being politely asked to return to its usual domain.
