# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Twist

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been having increasingly vivid dreams involving a particularly judgmental badger.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. Apparently, a specialist team was being dispatched – rumour had it they’d previously dealt with a minor uprising of sentient pebbles in a neighbouring county.  The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting. A Ministry of Silly Walks inspector was present, observing the council’s deliberations with a distinctly critical gaze.

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week. They’d received a cryptic postcard from a retired knight, Sir Reginald, who insisted on being consulted regarding structural integrity, and he’d demanded the frame be “properly Ni!” – a phrase he’d apparently learned during a brief stint with the Spanish Inquisition (circa 1482).

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated. Mr. Finch also pointed out that he'd spotted a dead parrot in Mrs. Higgins’ pet shop – a particularly unsettling occurrence, he suggested, given the unsettling rumours circulating about the parrot’s possible connection to a secret society of taxidermists.
