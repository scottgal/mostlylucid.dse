# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance (and a Slight Temporal Anomaly)

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists.  "It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints. We’ve requested a further assessment and a timeline for action, but no firm commitments have been made as yet.” 

A brief, unsettling silence fell over the meeting when Mr. Finch, the applicant for the storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill, nervously adjusted his spectacles. Witnesses reported a faint smell of ozone emanating from the area – a possible residual effect from a minor temporal disturbance observed earlier that week (officially, the council attributed it to a faulty kettle). 

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle were still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola.  A particularly enthusiastic volunteer, Mrs. Penelope Crumb, insisted on demonstrating her prize-winning gooseberry jam, claiming it possessed "certain...properties." 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns.  During this discussion, a single, perfectly formed dandelion appeared on Councillor Higgins’s desk, vanishing moments later - a phenomenon the council’s archivist, Mr. Silas Blackwood, vaguely referenced as “possibly related to the Knights of Ni who occasionally attend our meetings."  The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities, alongside a quiet acknowledgement that the village's resident badger, Bartholomew, had been observed wearing a tiny, bespoke waistcoat.
