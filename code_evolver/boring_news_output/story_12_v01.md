# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Dragon Sighting

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists – though Councillor Higgins did briefly suggest it might be a nesting site for a particularly grumpy Lesser Spotted Dragon, a theory dismissed with a shrug and a note about the Ministry of Silly Walks inspecting the local drainage.

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget. Councillor Margaret Higgins, chair of the meeting, noted that this was one of several minor maintenance issues currently being addressed across the parish – including a baffling incident involving a misplaced Spanish Inquisition and a considerable amount of paperwork regarding the proper disposal of deceased parrots at Mrs. Peterson’s pet shop.

Furthermore, a report was received from the village’s recycling officer, Mr. David Finch, detailing a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, and the council agreed to support this initiative. Apparently, a significant number of residents were confusing the paper collection with the collection of particularly melancholic Victorian novels – a common complaint, according to Mr. Finch.

Finally, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund. During the raffle, a local gentleman attempted to pay his winnings with a perfectly preserved Roman coin – a detail noted by Councillor Higgins, who murmured something about needing to update the parish’s historical records. “Just another Tuesday,” she concluded, before suggesting a brief pause for a collective "Ni!" – a habit she’d picked up during a particularly intense training session with the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors.
