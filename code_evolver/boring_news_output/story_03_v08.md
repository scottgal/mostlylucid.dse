# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses. Apparently, a particularly vocal group of local gnomes were consulted – they favoured the deep crimson variety, though a brief Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of their opinions yielded only shrugs.

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” He also muttered something about a suspected Spanish Inquisition relating to the rose’s lineage. Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance – a sum that prompted a brief, and utterly baffling, recollection of a rumour about a dragon attempting to run for mayor.

Following a brief, and largely unproductive, debate, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. Councillor Higgins briefly paused to assure everyone that no actual wizards were involved in the rose selection process.  A concerned resident, Mrs. Beatrice Chumley, suggested a small offering of shiny pebbles to appease the garden spirits – an idea promptly dismissed by the council, though a subsequent report noted a suspiciously high number of pigeons visiting the hall. 

The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout, with Highways England reporting minimal disruption – a reassuring fact, considering the ongoing legend of a phantom Roman chariot trapped beneath. Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves.  Someone discreetly pointed out that a particularly melancholic parrot, recently acquired from Mr. Finch’s pet shop, seemed to be judging the proceedings.
