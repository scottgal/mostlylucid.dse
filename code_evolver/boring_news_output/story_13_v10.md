# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And Slightly More

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists. Apparently, a local badger clan were involved in a minor territorial dispute, adding to the chaos – Constable Davies noted a concerning uptick in miniature dragon sightings near the Old Mill.

“It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints. We’ve requested a further assessment and a timeline for action, but no firm commitments have been made as yet. We did briefly discuss the possibility of employing a team of knights who insisted on saying ‘Ni’ during the proceedings - a strange custom, apparently.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle are still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. Mr. Finch, the applicant for the storage shed near the Old Mill, also brought a dead parrot from his pet shop – a rather unnerving addition to the proceedings. The Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors were present, conducting a particularly rigorous examination of the tea-making facilities.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. During the discussion, a heated debate arose concerning whether the shed’s design could adequately accommodate a family of escaped Roman centurions. The tea-making facilities were, as always, unanimously approved.
