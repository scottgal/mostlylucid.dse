# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And a Rather Persistent Pigeon

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists. She also noted a particularly aggressive flock of pigeons, allegedly descendants of a failed dragon breeding program from the 18th century – though she couldn’t definitively prove it.

“It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints. Apparently, they're also investigating reports of a rogue Spanish Inquisition operating within the drainage system – though that's just a rumour, I believe." She added, with a weary sigh, "We’ve requested a further assessment and a timeline for action, but no firm commitments have been made as yet.  Someone suggested offering them a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection as a motivational tactic, but it was swiftly dismissed.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle are still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola.  There was a brief, unsettling discussion about the origins of the prize-winning Victoria sponge; rumours suggested a connection to a deceased parrot collection at the local pet shop.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. The drainage issue, Councillor Higgins mused, "might be linked to the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of several garden gnomes – a local legend, really." The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities, and a surprising debate about the proper pronunciation of “Ni” – apparently, it’s crucial in the context of architectural planning.
