# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Minor Temporal Anomaly

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris – a surprisingly large collection of what appeared to be fossilized flamingo feathers was noted by the minutes, though the origin remains unclear.

Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been observing a peculiar shimmer in the hedgerows lately, suggesting perhaps a brief visit from a minor dimension. The Highways Department, incidentally, were reportedly investigating reports of a rogue squadron of knights who insist on saying “Ni” during road inspections – a rather frustrating custom.

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. The aim is to ensure the road is kept safe and tidy for all residents.” She also noted a brief, unsettling silence during a particularly vigorous debate about drainage, which some attendees attributed to a brief, unsuccessful Ministry of Silly Walks inspection. 

Following the discussion, the council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project – a project that, rumour has it, is being overseen by a committee obsessed with restoring ancient Roman plumbing.

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information, although some residents reported a brief but intense discussion about the potential for a Spanish Inquisition regarding improperly sorted glass.
