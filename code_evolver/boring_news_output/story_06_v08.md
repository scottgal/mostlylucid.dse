# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Slight Temporal Anomaly

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. Apparently, a small contingent of retired knights – they kept insisting on saying “Ni” during discussions – were also observing the situation with considerable interest.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. The team were reportedly being inspected by a Ministry of Silly Walks representative, though the exact reason for the inspection remained unclear.  There had been rumours of a particularly aggressive badger causing localised time distortions, though this was dismissed by the Highways Department as “statistical noise”. 

A brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week, which, according to local folklore, is the anniversary of the brief Spanish Inquisition that briefly occupied the village hall in 1488 – nobody quite remembered why.

Furthermore, a small collection of dead parrots was discovered in Mr. Herbert Peabody’s pet shop. The cause remains under investigation, though theories range from a botched experiment involving temporal displacement to a simple case of avian apathy. 

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated, and Councillor Davies hinted that a local dragon was considering running for mayor.  A brief mention was made of a particularly persistent flock of pigeons who seemed to be attempting to decipher the council minutes.
