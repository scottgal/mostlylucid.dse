# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance (And Other Matters)

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists. “It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints – apparently, they're diverting funds to investigate the migratory patterns of particularly aggressive puffins.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle are still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. Notably, several attendees were observed wearing small, polished helmets – a precaution taken after a local sighting of a particularly agitated badger, reportedly claiming to be a descendant of King Arthur and demanding a knighthood. 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. The meeting also involved a surprisingly detailed discussion about the optimal angle for the placement of a miniature Roman aqueduct – a suggestion originating from a gentleman claiming to be a direct descendant of a Roman surveyor, and insisting that the local water supply was 'possessed’ by a minor deity. The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities, and a whispered observation from Councillor Higgins that the floral arrangements seemed suspiciously similar to those used in the reported Spanish Inquisitions of 1492.
