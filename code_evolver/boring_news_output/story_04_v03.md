# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Slight Temporal Anomaly

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists – and, he *strongly* suspected, a potential nesting ground for miniature, disgruntled Welsh dragons.

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. The aim is to ensure the road is kept safe and tidy for all residents – though we’ve also been advised to keep an eye out for any lingering signs of the 1492 Spanish Inquisition, just in case.”

Following the discussion, the council briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project.  Mrs. Higgins remarked that she’d baked a particularly potent rhubarb crumble, “guaranteed to temporarily induce a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection.”

There was also a brief, somewhat unsettling, exchange regarding the interpretation of the new kerbside recycling collection schedule.  Councillor Davies, a self-proclaimed expert in temporal anomalies, noted that “the current timeline seems… flexible.  It’s reminiscent of that time the vicar tried to fix the church clock with a compass – a profoundly confusing experience.”  Finally, a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information.  Someone in the back row was loudly chanting "Ni!" – presumably a new member of the village choir.
