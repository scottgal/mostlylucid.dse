,## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Slight Temporal Anomaly

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. He did, however, briefly pause to swat at a persistent, shimmering dragonfly – a common occurrence, apparently linked to the last particularly strong ley line convergence.

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme” and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also muttered something about the unsettling habit of the local hedgehogs rearranging the gravel. Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” A member of the public, Mr. Silas Peabody, interrupted to declare he’d seen a brief flash of 15th-century armour during the last meeting, though this was dismissed by the council as a result of the ongoing Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the village hall’s flooring.

Following a lengthy discussion – and a particularly impassioned plea from Councillor Higgins regarding the possibility of incorporating miniature, trained griffins into the design – a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday. 

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets. A small delegation from the Upper Crumpington Historical Society were present, claiming the victory was partially due to a slightly misplaced time anomaly favouring their batsmen.
