# Parish Council Discusses Hedge Trimmed Near Miller’s Farm – And a Slightly Unsettling Hawk

## Ongoing Roadworks Cause Minor Traffic Delays, Witnesses Report Feathered Interference

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting on Tuesday evening, primarily focusing on a report regarding the trimming of a hawthorn hedge bordering the property of Mr. Arthur Finch, near Miller’s Farm. Concerns were raised by several residents regarding the height of the hedge and its potential impact on visibility for motorists – a particularly sensitive issue given the ongoing reports of spectral activity in the area.  Some residents muttered about a possible connection to the last reported sighting of Bartholomew, the itinerant mage, who’d been attempting to establish a small, frankly alarming, cult around the old mill. Following a brief discussion (and a rather pointed “Ni!” from Councillor Higgins regarding a particularly thorny issue), the council agreed to a £75.20 invoice from local hedge trimmer, Mr. Bernard Higgins, for the work which was completed last week.

Meanwhile, ongoing roadworks on the A307 near the village green continue to cause minor delays, particularly during peak commuting hours. Wessex Highways have confirmed that the resurfacing project is scheduled to be completed by Friday, October 27th, although delays due to inclement weather cannot be ruled out. Witnesses reported a brief, unsettling sighting of a large hawk circling the works site – a local ornithologist suggested it might be attempting to conduct a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the tarmac. Drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journeys.

Additionally, the Parish Council received three planning applications, all of which were deferred until the next meeting due to a lack of information. A request for the construction of a small chicken coop at Mrs. Penelope Davies’ residence was particularly lengthy, requiring several amendments to the submitted plans – apparently, the original blueprints involved a small, automated moat. 

Finally, the Little Puddleton Cricket Club reported a disappointing loss against Nether Wallop in the local league, scoring 147 all out. Details of the match can be found on the club’s website.  Rumours persist that the Nether Wallop team were aided by a surprisingly well-informed dead parrot from the village pet shop, a relic from a long-forgotten Spanish Inquisition.
