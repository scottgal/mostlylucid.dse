# Parish Council Discusses Hedge Trimmed Near Miller’s Farm – And Something Else Entirely

## Ongoing Roadworks Cause Minor Traffic Delays & a Brief Dragon Sighting

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting on Tuesday evening, primarily focusing on a report regarding the trimming of a hawthorn hedge bordering the property of Mr. Arthur Finch, near Miller’s Farm. Concerns were raised by several residents regarding the height of the hedge and its potential impact on visibility for motorists. Notably, a brief, shimmering disturbance was observed near the hedge – some speculate it was a young dragon, newly fledged and seeking a suitable nesting site. Wessex Highways have, unsurprisingly, denied any involvement, citing “standard bureaucratic protocols.”

Following a brief discussion, the council agreed to a £75.20 invoice from local hedge trimmer, Mr. Bernard Higgins, for the work which was completed last week. Mr. Higgins himself was later seen muttering about “temporal anomalies” and the unsettling way his hedge trimmer seemed to be shifting dimensions.

Meanwhile, ongoing roadworks on the A307 near the village green continue to cause minor delays, particularly during peak commuting hours. Wessex Highways have confirmed that the resurfacing project is scheduled to be completed by Friday, October 27th, although delays due to inclement weather cannot be ruled out. Drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journeys – and perhaps a small, silver trinket, just in case.

Additionally, the Parish Council received three planning applications, all of which were deferred until the next meeting due to a lack of information. A request for the construction of a small chicken coop at Mrs. Penelope Davies’ residence was particularly lengthy, requiring several amendments to the submitted plans. Council members were overheard debating the philosophical implications of poultry architecture.

Finally, the Little Puddleton Cricket Club reported a disappointing loss against Nether Wallop in the local league, scoring 147 all out. Details of the match can be found on the club’s website. The club president, Mr. Cecil Thornton, was seen practicing his Ministry of Silly Walks in preparation for the annual village fête.
