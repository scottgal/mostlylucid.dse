# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And a Possible Dragon sighting

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families. Refreshments were sold raising approximately £347.12 for the village’s fundraising efforts – a surprisingly large sum, considering the recent reports of a rogue Cornish pixie demanding payment for rain.

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem, though I did hear whispers that they’re also investigating the unusually high concentration of iridescent slime – apparently, it’s not entirely natural.”

A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services confirmed they were also examining a potential link to the recent sightings of a small, disgruntled dragon claiming to be a descendant of King Arthur. He added, “We’ve taken soil samples, though frankly, the smell is…distinctive.”

A brief, somewhat frantic discussion followed regarding the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste. Councillor Davies, a staunch advocate for the “Ministry of Silly Walks” inspections of bins, expressed his desire to personally oversee the implementation.

Finally, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out. The opposition captain was overheard muttering something about “ancient prophecies” before the match, and a small, leather-bound book was briefly glimpsed being consulted by a particularly intense supporter. The local pet shop had also recently received a shipment of deceased parrots – a detail seemingly unconnected, yet somehow unsettling.
