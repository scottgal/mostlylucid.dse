# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Time Anomaly

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, rather cryptically, that he’d been having recurring dreams involving a particularly judgmental badger.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting. It was noted that a small delegation from the Ministry of Silly Walks had been observing, ostensibly to assess pedestrian traffic flow, though rumours circulated about a potential investigation into the council’s unusually enthusiastic use of Morris dancers.

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week. There was a brief, unsettling discussion about the recent arrival of three perfectly preserved dodos at the village pet shop – the proprietor claimed they’d simply “materialised.”

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated. Councillor Davies also casually mentioned that a local historian had unearthed evidence suggesting a brief, and highly confused, Spanish Inquisition had taken place in Willow Creek during the 17th century, although the evidence was largely comprised of oddly shaped stones.  The whole thing ended with a pointed "Ni" from Councillor Higgins, who insisted he was simply stating the obvious.
