# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Slight Twist

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris – a situation he described as “remarkably reminiscent of the Last Supper, only with more dandelions.” 

Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists. Witnesses reported a brief, unsettling shimmer emanating from the verge during the discussion, attributed by some to a localised Ministry of Silly Walks inspection. 

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. The aim is to ensure the road is kept safe and tidy for all residents. Though, frankly, the council’s attempts to control the local gnome population have proven consistently… problematic.”

A brief, passionate debate erupted when a delegate from the Little Puddleton Historical Society asserted that the verge’s current state was directly linked to an ancient Spanish Inquisition, a theory quickly dismissed by Councillor Finch as “utter poppycock,” though a faint scent of sandalwood lingered in the air. 

Following the discussion, the council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project – a project rumored to be overseen by a particularly judgmental flock of pigeons. 

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information. Notably, a single, perfectly preserved dead parrot was observed in Mr. Higgins’ pet shop window – a detail that caused a significant, though ultimately unresolved, murmur amongst the attendees.
