# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – With a Slight Twist

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, incidentally, claimed to have briefly witnessed a miniature dragon negotiating with the local badger population about territorial rights. 

Council members, including Councillor Beatrice Plumtree (known for her impassioned speeches regarding the potential for synchronized swimming to improve village morale), reviewed photographic evidence. Mr. Finch’s assertion about the dragon was dismissed as “a fascinating, albeit unsubstantiated, theory,” though a brief Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the footpath was ordered – ostensibly to assess the structural integrity, but primarily to ensure no rogue pigeons were involved in any clandestine meetings. 

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385. Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget – a budget rumoured to have once been used to fund a local Inquest into the disappearance of a collection of antique parrots. 

Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting. A small contingent of residents, including Mrs. Doris Crabtree, raised concerns about the potential for increased badger activity – a concern which prompted Councillor Plumtree to suggest a “strategic deployment of cucumber sandwiches” as a deterrent. 

Additionally, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall. The council also reiterated the current recycling guidelines for the village, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection – a process they described as "a delicate dance with the forces of entropy."  Finally, a whispered rumour circulated that the local vicar was secretly training a team of knights to say “Ni” during council meetings.
