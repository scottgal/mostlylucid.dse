# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – And a Possible Dragon sighting

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays – attributed, some whispered, to a particularly stubborn badger – particularly on Tuesdays. A brief, unsettling discussion about an apparent Spanish Inquisition, allegedly involving a misplaced rosemary bush, was swiftly tabled by Councillor Davies after a constituent complained of “excessive floral interrogation.”

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton, voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change is expected to alleviate some pressure on the collection vehicles, though several attendees noted the potential for increased sightings of the aforementioned badger, who was reportedly attempting to run for mayor.

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities, though a particularly enthusiastic volunteer insisted he’d recently trained as a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector, a suggestion quickly dismissed. 

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week – though a small team were observed meticulously examining a collection of deceased parrots found in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop, a situation they attributed to “unexpected avian circumstances.” Councillor Higgins ended the meeting with a polite, yet pointed, “Ni,” before adjourning. The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th.
