# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And Other Matters

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation & The Case of the Missing Bluebell

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists – a situation she described as “remarkably reminiscent of the last Great Serpent Migration of ‘87.”

“It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints. Apparently, they’re diverting funds to investigate a possible infestation of miniature, bureaucratic dragons – a surprisingly common issue, it seems.” She paused, adding, “And yes, I did hear about the Spanish Inquisition’s recent Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the local butcher’s shop. Quite the spectacle.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle are still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. A particularly enthusiastic member of the congregation claimed to have seen a deceased parrot – a magnificent scarlet macaw – in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop, though he admitted it might have been a particularly convincing model.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. Councillor Davies, known for his staunch support of the "Ni" movement, offered a particularly impassioned, though ultimately irrelevant, contribution. The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities – a decision that prompted a brief, and entirely bewildered, discussion about the proper brewing temperature of Earl Grey.
