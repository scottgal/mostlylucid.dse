# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” However, the proposal met with considerable resistance from several members of the public. 

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot and suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender – or perhaps a small, trained badger; he’d heard they were surprisingly good at weeding. Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies, muttering something about a particularly aggressive strain that reminded her faintly of the unexpected Spanish Inquisitions of ‘78.

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues,” adding, almost as an afterthought, “and we’ve consulted with the Ministry of Silly Walks regarding the placement – apparently, a strategically positioned flamingo would be a delightful deterrent.”

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th.  Several attendees remarked on the particularly intense debate, recalling a local legend about a time when a council meeting was interrupted by a delegation of surprisingly polite dragons demanding to know why no one was offering them tea. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular, though one attendee reported a brief, unsettling sighting of a dead parrot in Mr. Penhaligon’s shed – a detail he dismissed as simply “a momentary lapse in his memory, you know?”
