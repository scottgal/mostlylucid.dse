# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And a Possible Goblin Dispute

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists. “It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints – apparently, there’s been a significant uptick in demand for goblin relocation services, which is diverting resources.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle are still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. There was a brief, unsettling mention from Mr. Peterson regarding a possible sighting of a knight clad in full armour arguing vehemently about the use of “Ni” at the proceedings – a recurring issue, apparently.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. The council members noted that local folklore suggested the mill was built on an ancient ley line, and that prolonged rainwater collection could potentially awaken dormant earth spirits. A representative from the Ministry of Silly Walks was also present, conducting a routine inspection of the tea-making facilities – primarily focused on the efficient use of the tea-tray. 

The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities. It was noted that the previous chair, Mr. Davies, had been found peacefully asleep amongst a collection of deceased parrots at the local pet shop – a detail that prompted a murmured discussion about the potential for extended warranties on all parish council equipment.
