# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And a Rather Persistent Unicorn

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families – including, reportedly, a delegation from the Society for the Ethical Treatment of Unicorns, who were observing with considerable interest.

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem and provide a preliminary report. We’ve also received a cryptic message suggesting a possible connection to a minor temporal distortion – the local historian, Mr. Fitzwilliam, is convinced a 14th-century knight vanished in a flash flood and may be responsible.  He’s been researching the local Knights Templar; there’s talk of a particularly zealous one named Sir Reginald who insisted on saying "Ni" during council meetings.”

A brief discussion ensued regarding the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste.  The Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors were present, conducting a routine assessment of the Village Hall’s flooring – apparently, a slight wobble was detected.

Furthermore, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out.  Mr. Fitzwilliam believes this score is directly linked to the appearance of a spectral batsman wielding a cricket bat carved from solidified moonlight.  “A most unsettling phenomenon,” he commented.  A small, deceased parrot was discovered in the pet shop window, reportedly a harbinger of bad luck – though the shopkeeper, Mr. Peabody, insisted it was simply a “resting parrot.”
