# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses. Apparently, a delegation from the Ministry of Silly Walks had recently inspected the hall, noting a distinct lack of flamboyant leg movements.

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” He added, somewhat cryptically, that he'd had a disturbing dream involving a sentient pink rose and a miniature Spanish Inquisition. 

Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance. Councillor Barnaby Finch, known locally for his insistence on reciting sonnets at council meetings (a recent incident involving a particularly dramatic reading of “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” and a bewildered flock of pigeons), questioned whether the roses were, in fact, protected by a secret order of knights who frequently responded to inquiries with a firm “Ni.” 

Following a brief, and largely unproductive, debate, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. A brief update was provided on the ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout, with Highways England reporting minimal disruption – although several residents noted the persistent rumour that badger gangs were attempting to sabotage the work. 

Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves. A local pet shop reported a significant influx of unusually eloquent parrots, leading some to suspect a temporal anomaly.
