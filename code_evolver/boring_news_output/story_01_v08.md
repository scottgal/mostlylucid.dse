# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – With a Twist

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, incidentally, was last seen attempting to train a family of badgers to deliver council notices.

Council members reviewed photographic evidence, noting a slight surface damage attributed to recent inclement weather. A brief, unsettling discussion arose concerning a possible connection to the recent uptick in sightings of miniature, disgruntled dragons near the river – a concern voiced by Councillor Mildred Periwinkle, who’d recently consulted with a specialist in faunal anomalies.

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385. Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget – a budget rumoured to have been partially funded by a successful grant application to support a local chapter of the Knights of Ni.

Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting. During the meeting, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall – a cake stall which, rumour had it, was regularly visited by representatives from the Ministry of Silly Walks, ostensibly for quality control.

Additionally, the council reiterated the current recycling guidelines for the village, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection. A small contingent of residents expressed concern regarding the changes – and, briefly, the potential for a resurgence of the local Spanish Inquisition. 

Finally, Councillor Higgins requested a pause to discuss the unusual number of deceased parrots appearing in the village pet shop; a situation she suspected was not entirely natural.
