# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Slight Twist

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists – though he did add, almost as an afterthought, that he’d once seen a badger attempting to navigate a particularly dense patch, muttering something about a “temporal anomaly.”

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget – a surprisingly large sum, considering Councillor Higgins mentioned a recent, highly unproductive Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the village square.

Mr. David Finch, the village’s recycling officer, reported a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, citing a possible influence from a rogue flock of Spanish Inquisition parrots who’d apparently been distributing pamphlets on the dangers of improper paper disposal. 

Councillor Higgins noted that this was one of several minor maintenance issues currently being addressed across the parish, including the ongoing mystery of the vanished prize-winning marrow from last year’s fete – a case that some speculated involved a particularly ambitious group of garden gnomes. 

Furthermore, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund.  A surprising number of attendees had also been overheard debating the merits of knights who consistently responded to queries with a firm "Ni," a habit attributed to a recent influx of temporal tourists.  Finally, a single, perfectly preserved dead parrot was discovered in Mrs. Davies’ pet shop – a detail which, according to Mr. Penhaligon, “felt oddly significant.”
