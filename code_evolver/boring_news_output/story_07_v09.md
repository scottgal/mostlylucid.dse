# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – And Other Matters

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays – particularly on Tuesdays, when the local badger population seems to have an unusually aggressive interest in the refuse trucks. 

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton, and a brief, unsettling observation by Councillor Davies regarding a suspiciously large number of pigeons congregating near the bins, voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. Apparently, the shift was timed to coincide with the expected arrival of the travelling Spanish Inquisition, though they haven’t arrived yet. 

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges – a surprisingly popular offering amongst the local pixies, who were reportedly seen attempting to trade them for shiny buttons. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities, though one gentleman insisted on demonstrating his Ministry of Silly Walks routine whilst handing out face paint.

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week, though they did mention a strangely persistent rumour of a miniature dragon running for mayor of the nearby village of Nether Puddleton.  A particularly vocal resident also raised concerns about the number of dead parrots appearing in the local pet shop, suggesting a possible connection to the aforementioned dragon. The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th.  Councillor Higgins noted, “Just don't ask about the pigeons.”
