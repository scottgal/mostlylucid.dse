# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design – And a Possible Dragon sighting

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses – one even boasted a faint shimmer, prompting speculation about a possible Ministry of Silly Walks inspection.

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that he’d seen a rather disgruntled-looking iguana near the duck pond – apparently, some locals believed it was a displaced nobleman, fleeing an unexpected Spanish Inquisition.

Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance. Councillor Bartholomew Finch, a staunch advocate for the ‘Crimson Cascade’ design (which, rumour had it, was secretly funded by a group of retired knights who insisted on saying “Ni” during every council meeting), raised the point that the roses were, in his opinion, “perfectly suited for summoning a minor demon.” 

Following a brief, and largely unproductive, debate, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. A brief update was given on the ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout, with Highways England reporting minimal disruption, though a local ornithologist noted an unusual number of puffins were being observed – something he attributed to a temporal anomaly.

Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves. A surprising number of attendees were seen wearing miniature, plastic dragons – a trend linked, some whispered, to a particularly ambitious candidate running for mayor in the upcoming local elections.
