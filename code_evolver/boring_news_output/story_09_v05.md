# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Unicorn Sighting

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance & the Curious Case of Reginald

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists – though he did add, almost as an afterthought, that he’d seen a rather agitated badger attempting to hitch a ride on a passing lorry – a phenomenon the council’s Ministry of Silly Walks inspection team were strangely unconcerned about.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks – although rumours persisted that the contractors were secretly collecting data for a potential dragon-tracking project. 

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – reportedly guarded by a surprisingly knowledgeable parrot who claimed to have witnessed an unexpected Spanish Inquisition in 1492.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. Councillor Davies, during a particularly impassioned debate, briefly referenced a local legend about a time-traveling knight who insisted on responding to every question with “Ni,” before abruptly declaring the meeting adjourned, citing a sudden need to investigate a reported outbreak of miniature, self-folding origami swans.
