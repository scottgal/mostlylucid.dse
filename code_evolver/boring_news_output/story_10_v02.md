## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Minor Dragon Incident

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. Apparently, a particularly grumpy gnome had been observed muttering about “the decline of robust colour schemes” – a common complaint amongst the local garden ornament community.

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums "provided a robust and reliable colour scheme" and that a paler shade might "dilute the overall visual appeal." He also noted a peculiar lack of dragon sightings recently, suggesting a potential correlation. Witnesses reported a brief, shimmering disturbance near the old mill last week, but no actual dragons were present – just a lot of displaced gravel.

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” She also mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that she’d been receiving unsettling letters signed ‘The Order of the Silent Spade’ – a surprisingly active group obsessed with ensuring proper topsoil compaction. 

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday. 

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets. Councillor Higgins was overheard muttering about the possibility of commissioning a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the cricket pitch, citing concerns about “excessive leg-spin.”
