# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. Apparently, a small delegation of particularly disgruntled pygmy dragons had been spotted attempting to use the lane as a shortcut – a matter briefly debated under ‘Public Commentary’.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th.  The council also noted a concerning rumour circulating about an unexpected Spanish Inquisition originating from the local antique shop – a particularly ornate cassock was the suspected culprit.

The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting.  A small, slightly bewildered, team of Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors were observed observing the proceedings, ostensibly to assess the efficiency of the road maintenance.

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week.  Several villagers reported a strange, persistent odour emanating from the pet shop – a collection of particularly judgmental dead parrots was suspected to be involved.

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated. Councillor Davies reminded attendees to "Ni" when signing up, a custom apparently favoured by several long-serving members.  The local vicar, Mr. Silas Blackwood, was overheard muttering about the dangers of excessive rhubarb pie.
