# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – And Other Matters

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays, particularly on Tuesdays – a day some believe is intrinsically linked to the annual arrival of the Spanish Inquisition (though the Council assured residents this was merely a rumour).

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton, voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This was largely due to a persistent rumour that a small, territorial dragon was attempting to hoard the collection vehicles – a theory dismissed by Mr. Finch, who insisted on a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the area.

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges – a vital contribution, given the recent influx of remarkably lifelike dead parrots into the village pet shop. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities, though one gentleman was overheard muttering something about “protecting the sacred Ni” before a meeting.

The council also received an update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week, despite a minor incident involving a particularly stubborn badger and a surveyor's transit.  A brief discussion about the potential for a village-wide synchronized walking competition was tabled for the next meeting, following a suggestion from Councillor Higgins. The meeting concluded with a reminder to residents to keep their recycling bins free of any miniature, disgruntled Roman emperors. The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th.
