# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And a Slightly Unsettling Goat

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families. Refreshments were sold raising approximately £347.12 for the village’s fundraising efforts – a surprisingly large sum, according to Councillor Higgins, who mentioned briefly that a local badger had been observed attempting to purchase a cream tea with acorns.

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem and provide a preliminary report. Apparently, they’ve had to deal with a rather persistent gnome infestation lately, quite standard for this area, really.” 

A particularly agitated Mr. Barnaby Finch complained about a sudden, inexplicable arrival of Spanish Inquisitors – though the council assured him this was likely a misunderstanding involving a local historical reenactment group.  “We’ve had a few strange occurrences over the years,” Councillor Davies remarked, “including a brief, but intense, Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the Village Hall’s floorboards.”

A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services confirmed they’d also been investigating reports of a small, iridescent dragon residing near the church’s west wall – a creature they tentatively identified as “a juvenile Common Welsh Green with a penchant for collecting discarded buttons.” The council briefly discussed the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste. 

Finally, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out.  Someone remarked that the Bampton batsmen looked suspiciously like they'd been practicing with a particularly aggressive flock of pigeons – a theory currently under investigation by the Parish Council’s Ornithological Subcommittee.
