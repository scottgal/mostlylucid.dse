# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists – and, he added, a likely nesting site for the Lesser Spotted Dragon, though the Highways Department insisted they’d been conducting routine Ministry of Silly Walks inspections lately, looking for any signs of spontaneous combustion.

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. We’ve even had a delegation from the Order of St. John investigating reports of a minor, localised Spanish Inquisition – apparently some residents were hoarding excessively large pumpkins.” 

Following the discussion, the council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project. There was a brief, unsettling debate about whether the prize-winning marrow should be displayed with a taxidermied parrot – a discussion quickly adjourned after a senior member of the WI declared he’d just received a strongly worded letter from the Ministry of Silly Walks.

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information. Mr. Penhaligon was overheard suggesting that a small donation to the council would ensure the continued, discreet monitoring of badger activity – a suggestion met with polite, but firm, silence.  And just before the meeting adjourned, someone remarked that the newly installed paving stones seemed strangely warm to the touch.
