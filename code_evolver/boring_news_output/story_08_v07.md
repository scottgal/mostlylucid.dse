# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design – With a Slight Twist

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” Notably, a brief, unsettling rumour circulated about a local dragon – reportedly named Bartholomew – attempting to run for mayor, though this was swiftly dismissed by the council. 

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot and suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender. He also mentioned, rather casually, that his prize-winning marrow had been exhibiting signs of sentience – a worrying development that reminded him of the 16th-century Spanish Inquisitions. 

Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies. She also remarked that she’d seen a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector observing the local postman, suggesting a sudden, unexpected review of all village postal routes. 

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues.” A brief, but pointed, intervention occurred when Councillor Nigel Thornton declared, “Ni!” – a seemingly random utterance that prompted a hasty clarification from the chair that it was a nod to his ancestral lineage. 

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A peculiar incident involving a deceased parrot found in Mr. Herbert Davies’ pet shop sparked a brief, intensely scrutinised inspection by the local constabulary – though the cause of death remained stubbornly unclear. 

A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular.  Rumours continued to swirl about a mysterious group of knights who periodically appeared during council meetings, chanting “Ni!” – a baffling ritual that nobody quite understood.
