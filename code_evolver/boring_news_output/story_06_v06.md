# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Sasquatch Sighting

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. Apparently, a local badger had been observed attempting to build a miniature castle out of the material – something Councillor Davies attributed to “seasonal eccentricities.”

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting. A brief inspection by the Ministry of Silly Walks team was also noted, though they declared the lane perfectly serviceable, just “a bit… energetic.” 

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week. It was rumoured that the frame was built by a retired knight who insisted on chanting “Ni” during the assembly, a habit the council politely tolerated.

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated. Notably, a local historian had recently unearthed evidence suggesting a small Spanish Inquisition took place in the village during the 16th century - involving a particularly stubborn collection of rutabagas.  And, as a final, unsettling note, several villagers reported seeing a large, hairy figure near the creek – though the Highways team dismissed it as a “particularly robust sheep.”
