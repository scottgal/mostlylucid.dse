the# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Slight Twist

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he'd been having unsettling dreams involving a family of miniature, sentient badgers.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue. Councillor Beatrice Higgins noted that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks – a surprisingly efficient operation, considering the rumors circulating about their involvement with a clandestine society of competitive gnome breeders.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – allegedly guarded by a surprisingly philosophical tortoise.  There was a brief, awkward moment when Councillor Davies attempted to explain the origins of his custom-made ceremonial walking stick, claiming it was "remarkably resistant to Ministry of Silly Walks inspections."

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties.  A witness reported hearing a faint chanting emanating from the site, possibly connected to the recent, inexplicable appearance of a single, perfectly preserved dead parrot in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop – a detail that, unsurprisingly, prompted a brief, impassioned plea from Councillor Higgins for an investigation into potential time-travel shenanigans.  Someone also remarked on the unusually high concentration of 'Ni' being uttered during the proceedings.
