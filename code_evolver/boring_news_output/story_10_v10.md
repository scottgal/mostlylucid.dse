## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Hint of the Unexplainable

**Little Puddleton –** The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink.  A particularly agitated robin was observed circling the room during this initial announcement; witnesses reported it was muttering something about "sacrilege."

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme” and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been having unsettling dreams involving synchronized swimming dragons, though he attributed it to the new chamomile tea the Ministry of Silly Walks had recommended.

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” She claimed the colour was chosen after a consultation with a travelling troupe of Renaissance mimes, and that they’d insisted on a shade “reflective of the existential angst of a particularly melancholic parrot.”  A brief but intense argument erupted when Councillor Davies declared that he’d seen a spectral vicar attempting to dismantle the geraniums with a tiny silver trowel – a claim dismissed by the meeting’s secretary as “seasonal eccentricity.”

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday.  A representative from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Unexplained Phenomena was present, taking notes on the entire event, noting a distinct lack of temporal anomalies.

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets.  A small group of villagers were observed attempting to engage in a spirited debate about the proper pronunciation of “Ni” – a habit frequently adopted by members of the Knight’s Order of the Slightly Confused.
