# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists – and, he added with a significant frown, possibly a breeding ground for miniature, disgruntled griffins.

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. The aim is to ensure the road is kept safe and tidy for all residents.” A brief, unsettling pause followed as a delegate from the Ministry of Silly Walks conducted a surprisingly thorough inspection of the council chamber’s floorboards, muttering something about “structural instability” and “temporal anomalies.”

Following the discussion, the council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project – which, rumour had it, was being subtly reinforced with ancient Roman concrete, a legacy of a particularly enthusiastic, if somewhat confused, historical society.

A surprisingly passionate debate arose regarding the optimal angle for a ceremonial pumpkin carving, culminating in a brief intervention by a representative from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Dragons, who argued for a ‘rotational carving’ system to prevent pumpkin-related trauma. Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information – though a cryptic note appended to the website suggested a temporary suspension due to “unforeseen avian interference.”
