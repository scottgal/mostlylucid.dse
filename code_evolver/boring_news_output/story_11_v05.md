# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – With a Curious Twist

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated by a lengthy discussion regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds – and, according to a whispered rumour circulating amongst the members, a suspected minor infestation of miniature, surprisingly articulate dragons. 

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members, though Councillor Arthur Finch did briefly suggest a temporary protective barrier – apparently designed to ward off any further dragon activity – costing approximately £150. He’d been researching ancient protective wards, he explained, after a particularly unsettling Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the village square (apparently, a sudden, synchronized shuffle was deemed ‘disruptive’).

Several concerns were raised, primarily regarding the potential impact on the existing paving stones. A local historian, Mr. Silas Peabody, was present and pointed out that the square had, in 1487, briefly been the site of a rather spirited, if ultimately unsuccessful, Spanish Inquisition – a detail he insisted was crucial to understanding the structural integrity of the paving. 

The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion. Councillor Davies, known for his staunch adherence to protocol, was overheard muttering something about “the Knights of Ni” – a bizarre development he attributed to a recent shipment of imported tea. 

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against. A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls. 

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details.  A lone, perfectly preserved macaw sat silently in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop window - a reminder, perhaps, of a past council decision.
