# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Unicorn Sighting

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance & the Persistent Smell of Cinnamon

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that he’d been observing a peculiar iridescent shimmer near the old mill – possibly a young unicorn, though the Highways Department assured him that their Ministry of Silly Walks inspections hadn’t detected any temporal anomalies.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks. It was noted that the contractors had a surprisingly high rate of "Ni" declarations during meetings, a habit the Clerk attributed to a recent, unusually intense training session on medieval chivalry.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – rumour had it, the tin was inexplicably filled with miniature, perfectly formed loaves of sourdough. A strange, lingering scent of cinnamon was also present in the hall, which some attributed to a visiting delegation from a particularly zealous Spanish Inquisition (they were apparently researching the optimal method for drying herbs).

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties.  Councillor Davies commented that a dead parrot had been found in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop, and suggested this might be a relevant indicator for the planning application.
