# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Dragon Sighting

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, quite casually, that he’d been observing peculiar shimmering lights near the old mill – possibly related to the rumored nocturnal activity of a small, rather disgruntled dragon.  Nobody seemed particularly concerned.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting.  She also noted the recent uptick in reports of spontaneous Spanish Inquisitions popping up in the rose bushes – a problem the council was actively monitoring.

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week. Councillor Bartholomew Higgins, a staunch advocate for the Ministry of Silly Walks inspections, was present and suggested a particularly vigorous step for everyone. 

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated – and a note was appended: “Please avoid bringing any unusually large pigeons.  They’ve been exhibiting a concerning level of interest in the fundraising efforts.”  A local man, Mr. Silas Blackwood, was overheard muttering about knights who insisted on saying "Ni" during council debates.
