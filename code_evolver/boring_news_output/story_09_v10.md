details# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Rather Persistent Pigeon

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance – Plus, a Minor Dragon Incident

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that he’d seen a small, emerald dragon attempting to scale the village noticeboard – apparently, they’re quite partial to leaflets advertising the upcoming Village Fete.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks. A brief, but unsettling, debate followed regarding the potential for ritualistic sacrifices to appease the roadworks – a suggestion swiftly dismissed by Councillor Davies, who reminded everyone of the Ministry of Silly Walks inspection protocols.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop. There were murmurs about a possible Spanish Inquisition investigating the lack of marmalade donations.

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. Councillor Higgins noted a concerning number of knights were attending, and several were chanting “Ni!” during the discussion. A dead parrot was spotted in the window of Mr. Henderson’s Pet Emporium - a particularly unsettling detail. 

The meeting concluded with a unanimous vote to investigate the persistent pigeon problem – apparently, they were attempting to establish a parliamentary committee.
