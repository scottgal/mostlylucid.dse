# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses. 

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance. 

Following a brief, and largely unproductive, debate, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout, with Highways England reporting minimal disruption. 

Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves.
