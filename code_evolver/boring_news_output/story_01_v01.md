# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – And a Possible Dragon Sighting

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, incidentally, claims to have seen a juvenile dragon attempting to scale the old oak tree at the corner. The council assured Mr. Finch that, while the dragon sighting hadn’t been formally investigated (the Ministry of Silly Walks had been consulted, but deemed it “a matter of purely aesthetic concern”), the footpath was being addressed.

Council members reviewed photographic evidence and confirmed a small amount of surface damage caused by recent inclement weather. There was a brief, murmured discussion about the possibility of a localised time warp occurring near the affected area, though this was swiftly dismissed by Councillor Beatrice Plumtree, who insisted on a thorough Ministry of Silly Walks inspection – just in case.

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385. Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget. Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting.

Additionally, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall. There was a brief, confusing argument about whether Mrs. Higgins’ sponges were genuinely made with free-range eggs – a point raised by Mr. Finch, who also insisted on a small, ceremonial offering of pickled onions to appease the spirits of the road. The council also reiterated the current recycling guidelines for the village, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection. A small contingent of residents expressed concern regarding the changes, primarily citing a rumour that the sorting process was subtly influencing their dreams.
