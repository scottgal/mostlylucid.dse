# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – And a Possible Dragon Sighting

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, incidentally, was observed later that day attempting to train a small, surprisingly disgruntled badger in the churchyard.

Council members reviewed photographic evidence and confirmed a small amount of surface damage caused by recent inclement weather. There were murmurs, largely dismissed, about a local sighting of a juvenile dragon – purportedly attempting to use the pothole as a nesting site. A Ministry of Silly Walks inspection team briefly visited to assess the situation, primarily to ensure Mr. Davies’ equipment wasn't interfering with the local badger's potential real estate.

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385. Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget. Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting – and hopefully without further badger-related incidents.

Additionally, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall. A representative from the Historical Society briefly discussed the potential for a Spanish Inquisition-themed stall, judging the quality of the sponge cakes. 

The council also reiterated the current recycling guidelines for the village, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection. A small contingent of residents expressed concern regarding the changes – largely fuelled by rumours of a rogue parrot who’d been spotted rearranging the recycling bins. The meeting concluded with a brief, impassioned plea from Councillor Higgins regarding the declining number of properly-labelled bin bags.
