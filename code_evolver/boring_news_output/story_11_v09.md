# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – With a Peculiar Twist

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated by a lengthy discussion regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds – a particularly important consideration given the recent sightings of miniature, disgruntled dragons circling the church spire. 

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members. A brief, unsettling pause occurred when Councillor Arthur Finch, a staunch advocate for the protection of ancient paving stones, claimed to have witnessed a shadowy figure attempting to dismantle the square's foundations – a claim swiftly dismissed as likely involving a particularly ambitious group of Roman reenactors. 

Several concerns were raised, primarily regarding the potential impact on the existing paving stones. Councillor Finch suggested a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage.  The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion - a rule that seemed to particularly irritate a local historian who insisted the bins were actually ancient Aztec refuse containers. 

A disconcerting silence fell over the proceedings when Councillor Davies, a known enthusiast for competitive ferret racing, interjected with a fervent “Ni!” – a habit he’d apparently picked up during a brief, unconfirmed stint as a papal emissary. The meeting also briefly touched upon the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls – including one from a gentleman selling hand-knitted scarves featuring surprisingly detailed depictions of the Spanish Inquisition. 

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details – though a cryptic warning about "temporal anomalies" was subtly added to the FAQ.  A small, deceased parrot was also noted in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop, a detail the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors were reportedly investigating. The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against.
