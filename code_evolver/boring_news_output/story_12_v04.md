# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Sasquatch Sighting

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists – and, he *strongly* believed, a prime nesting location for particularly territorial blue jays. Councillor Higgins noted a similar concern raised last month concerning a small, shimmering object near the duck pond, which the local constabulary attributed to a particularly enthusiastic reflection.

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget. During the discussion, Councillor Davies reportedly muttered something about the inherent instability of borders and a brief, unsettling recollection of a Spanish Inquisition – though he quickly clarified this was simply a very enthusiastic review of the local history book.

Furthermore, a report was received from the village’s recycling officer, Mr. David Finch, detailing a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, and the council agreed to support this initiative. A particularly fervent debate ensued when Mr. Finch mentioned the recent sighting of a figure resembling a large, furry primate near the allotments – though the constabulary assured everyone this was likely just a particularly tall badger.

Finally, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund. Councillor Higgins also revealed she’d been fielding inquiries about a local legend concerning a knight who consistently responded to queries with a firm “Ni,” though he seemed to be attending meetings to observe the Ministry of Silly Walks inspections.
