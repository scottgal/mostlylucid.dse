# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – With a Peculiar Twist

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated – as usual – by a surprisingly passionate debate regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds. She did, however, briefly mention the local historian’s theory about Roman legionaries having used the square as a practice ground for synchronized maneuvers – a claim currently being investigated by a small, surprisingly well-equipped team of archaeo-botanists. 

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members, although Councillor Arthur Finch did suggest a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage. He was, incidentally, wearing a miniature suit of armour – a family heirloom, he explained, and the only one he could find that fit comfortably. 

Several concerns were raised, including a rumour circulating about a local badger having developed a disconcerting fondness for Victorian-era poetry. The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion – a particularly strict requirement, apparently, due to the Ministry of Silly Walks’ recent inspection of the area. 

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against. A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls – mostly for selling miniature catapults. 

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details, and to avoid making eye contact with the strangely unsettling collection of dead parrots currently residing in Mrs. Miggins’ Pet Emporium.
