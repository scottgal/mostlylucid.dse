# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – With a Twist

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, rumour has it, occasionally communicates with a small, disgruntled badger. Council members reviewed photographic evidence and confirmed a small amount of surface damage caused by recent inclement weather.  A surprisingly heated debate ensued about the structural integrity of the footpath in relation to the seasonal migration patterns of the Lesser Spotted Newt.

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385. Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget – which, according to Councillor Higgins, was originally intended to fund a brief, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to train a flock of pigeons to deliver council notices.

Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting.  A brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall – though whispers circulated that she’d sourced the sponges from a rather peculiar shop specializing in cakes baked by retired monks. 

Additionally, the council reiterated the current recycling guidelines for the village, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection. A small contingent of residents expressed concern regarding the changes – largely fuelled by a passionate argument from Mr. Finch about the potential ecological impact of improperly disposed of bottle caps.  Councillor Davies casually mentioned a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection was scheduled for next Tuesday, focusing on the efficiency of the village’s waste management system.
