# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – No Major Decisions Made (With a Slight Twist)

## Residents Attend Meeting in Little Puddleton, Concerns Raised About Route Efficiency

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, attended by a modest gathering of approximately fifteen residents, including a surprisingly articulate badger who’d apparently been observing the proceedings. The primary item on the agenda was a review of the current kerbside waste collection route, proposed by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, who was later spotted arguing with a local gnome about the optimal angle for composting.

Councillor Higgins argued for a revised schedule to minimize disruption to residents’ access and to optimise collection times, citing anecdotal evidence of residents struggling to access their bins on certain days – a situation she attributed, somewhat dramatically, to “temporal distortions.” Following a brief discussion, the council voted to commission a short survey from local waste management company, Green Solutions Ltd, to assess the current route's efficiency. The survey will focus on identifying areas of congestion and potential bottlenecks, though a representative from the company reportedly spent a significant amount of time examining a particularly shiny pebble.

Several residents voiced concerns regarding the potential impact of the changes, primarily regarding the timing of collections and the impact on access for elderly residents. Notably, Mr. Arthur Peabody suggested a solution involving trained carrier pigeons, a proposal met with a lukewarm reception and a muttered reference to a particularly zealous Spanish Inquisition from Councillor Higgins. 

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming village fete, scheduled for July 15th, and a reminder to residents to register for the new recycling scheme, which is due to be implemented next month. The fete committee confirmed that the bake sale will be raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, and a raffle will be held – prizes included a signed portrait of a deceased parrot, and a surprisingly well-preserved miniature dragon. No decisions were made regarding the planning application for a new garden shed on Mr. Harold Finch’s property, although a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector was observed meticulously documenting the placement of a particularly robust paving stone.
