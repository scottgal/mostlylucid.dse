# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – And a Slight Anomaly

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays in collections, particularly on Tuesdays – a fact noted by Mr. Fitzwilliam, who claimed he’d seen a small, shimmering dragon attempting to access his bin, though this was dismissed by the council as a “seasonal optical illusion.”

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton, voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change is expected to alleviate some pressure on the collection vehicles. Councillor Davies mentioned that a team of volunteer ‘Ni’ knights had briefly attended the meeting, simply stating “Ni” during the discussion on traffic flow - a tradition they apparently uphold.

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities. There was a noticeable pause in conversation when Mrs. Higgins mentioned that the Ministry of Silly Walks had recently conducted an inspection of the village green, citing “excessive waddling” amongst the attendees.

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week.  A peculiar incident involving a deceased parrot discovered in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop was quickly glossed over, with the manager simply stating it was "a particularly philosophical bird." The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th.
