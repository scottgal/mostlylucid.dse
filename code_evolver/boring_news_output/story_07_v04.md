# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – And a Rather Persistent Pigeon

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays in collections, particularly on Tuesdays – a phenomenon some whisper is linked to the unusually high concentration of spectral librarians residing near the river. 

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton, voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change is expected to alleviate some pressure on the collection vehicles – although Mr. Penhaligon, the baker, noted that his Victoria sponges seemed to be attracting a surprisingly large number of magpies, possibly due to a temporal anomaly. 

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities, although one gentleman insisted on demonstrating his “Ministry of Silly Walks” inspection technique whilst discussing the bouncy castle. 

The council also received a rather agitated update from the roadworks team on Mill Road, who reported minimal disruption this week – mostly due to the unusually cooperative behaviour of a family of hedgehogs who were apparently providing surprisingly accurate directional guidance.  They mentioned, almost casually, that a small group of historians were investigating a suspected, albeit highly improbable, Spanish Inquisition that occurred in the village circa 1485, and that the local vicar was vehemently advocating for the council to invest in a large, ornate parrot. 

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks, and a reminder that Councillor Higgins was still attempting to train a squad of knights to say “Ni” during council meetings – a project deemed “progressively more perplexing” by several attendees. The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th.
