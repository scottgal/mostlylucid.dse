# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – No Major Decisions Made (With a Twist)

## Residents Attend Meeting in Little Puddleton, Concerns Raised About Route Efficiency

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, attended by a modest gathering of approximately fifteen residents – including, reportedly, a delegation from the Society for the Preservation of Perfectly Polished Pebbles. The primary item on the agenda was a review of the current kerbside waste collection route, proposed by Councillor Beatrice Higgins. Councillor Higgins argued for a revised schedule to minimize disruption to residents’ access and to optimise collection times, citing anecdotal evidence of residents struggling to access their bins on certain days – a situation she described as “remarkably reminiscent of the last time the Ministry of Silly Walks conducted a public inspection.”

Following a brief discussion, the council voted to commission a short survey from local waste management company, Green Solutions Ltd, to assess the current route's efficiency. The survey will focus on identifying areas of congestion and potential bottlenecks. Several residents voiced concerns regarding the potential impact of the changes, primarily regarding the timing of collections and the impact on access for elderly residents. One particularly vocal attendee, Mrs. Agatha Plumtree, claimed she'd seen a badger wearing a tiny fez near her bins – “a perfectly normal occurrence, really, given the recent uptick in reported sightings of interdimensional squirrels.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming village fete, scheduled for July 15th, and a reminder to residents to register for the new recycling scheme, which is due to be implemented next month. The fete committee confirmed that the bake sale will be raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, and a raffle will be held. A brief discussion also touched upon the ongoing debate about whether a new garden shed on Mr. Harold Finch’s property should be constructed with a subtle, iridescent sheen – a proposal that some felt echoed the spirit of the last, ill-fated Spanish Inquisition (though no actual Inquisitions were observed). No decisions were made regarding the planning application. 

Finally, Councillor Higgins briefly mentioned the local rumour about a knight who always responded to council meetings with a firm “Ni,” insisting it was a perfectly reasonable way to express disagreement.
