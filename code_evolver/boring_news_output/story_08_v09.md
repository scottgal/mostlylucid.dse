# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” A brief, unsettling murmur rippled through the room as she pointed out a particularly vibrant bloom – witnesses reported a fleeting glimpse of what appeared to be a miniature, fully-armoured knight examining it closely, muttering something about “the proper alignment of petals.”

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot, suggesting a more hardy alternative, such as lavender. He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that he'd been having trouble with a family of particularly aggressive badgers who seemed to be attempting to establish a claim on the rose bushes – a local historian briefly recalled an unexpected Spanish Inquisition in the village during the 17th century, involving a rather confused shipment of oranges.

Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies. She also noted a strange, rhythmic pulsing emanating from the earth beneath the flower bed, which she attributed to the ongoing Ministry of Silly Walks inspections of the local drain system. Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues,” adding that a specialist from the Department of Unexplained Floral Phenomena was scheduled to arrive later that week.

The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular, and a lone, impeccably dressed parrot was observed sitting on the counter, occasionally repeating the phrase “Ni.”
