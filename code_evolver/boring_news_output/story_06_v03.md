# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Peculiar Incident Involving a Goose

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, rather cryptically, that he’d been observing a particularly agitated gaggle of geese – a phenomenon he suspected was linked to the recent uptick in Ministry of Silly Walks inspections.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting. A brief, unsettling conversation about a local taxidermist’s unusual collection of dead parrots (apparently, they were prone to philosophical debates) was also noted.

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week – though there were murmurs that the previous frame had briefly been haunted by a particularly grumpy knight who insisted on shouting "Ni!" at every meeting.

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated. Councillor Davies assured everyone that the local chapter of the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Inquisitions was not involved, despite a suspicious number of pamphlets about the dangers of excessive marmalade consumption being distributed.
