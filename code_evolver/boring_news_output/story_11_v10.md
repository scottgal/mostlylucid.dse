# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – With a Twist

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated, as always, by a surprisingly passionate debate regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds – a factor apparently significant to a local rumour about a minor dragon settlement nesting beneath the square. 

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members. Councillor Arthur Finch suggested a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage – a suggestion that immediately prompted a brief, and entirely unproductive, discussion about the potential for a miniature Spanish Inquisition to investigate structural weaknesses. 

Several concerns were raised, including a disconcerting report from Mr. Peterson regarding unusually aggressive pigeons; he claimed they were attempting to recite Shakespeare.  The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion – a matter frequently scrutinized by the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors, who, according to Councillor Davies, were particularly interested in the angle of the bins. 

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against – primarily because they were attempting to decipher a coded message left by a deceased parrot found in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop.  A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls – several of which were advertised as “Guaranteed to Contain Slightly Haunted Objects.” 

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details, a website that, rumour had it, was being monitored by agents from the Department of Temporal Anomalies, investigating reports of flickering streetlights.
