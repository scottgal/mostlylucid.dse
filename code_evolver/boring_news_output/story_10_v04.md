## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Peculiar Twist

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. Apparently, a visiting delegation from the Ministry of Silly Walks had been observing council meetings lately, and Councillor Finch admitted he’d been practicing his waddle in anticipation.

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme” and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also noted, with a significant frown, that several villagers had reported sightings of miniature dragons attempting to hoard the geraniums – a persistent problem, he claimed, linked to a series of unusually high geomagnetic readings. 

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” She briefly mentioned that she’d received a cryptic postcard from a retired knight, Sir Reginald, who insisted on shouting “Ni!” during discussions about shrubbery.  “He says it’s a traditional sign of disapproval,” she explained.

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday.  A representative from the local Historical Society pointed out that the previous geraniums had been grown from seeds salvaged from a surprisingly well-preserved Spanish Inquisition, adding a distinctly unsettling note to the proceedings.

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets.  A brief, unsettling silence fell when Mr. Finch announced the local pet shop had recently closed down with a collection of dead parrots – a completely unrelated event, he assured everyone.
