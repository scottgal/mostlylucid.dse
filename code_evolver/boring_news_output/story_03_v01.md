# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design – And a Possible Goblin Uprising

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was, predictably, the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses. Apparently, the council had been receiving unusually detailed reports of rose petal discoloration – some suspected a minor goblin uprising in the local soil.

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” He also noted, rather disconcertingly, that a small, perfectly formed toadstool had been observed performing a synchronized Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the soil.

Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance. There was a brief, and largely unproductive, debate, punctuated by Councillor Higgins’ insistence that the council was “absolutely not” considering incorporating a miniature dragon into the design – a suggestion that seemed to have originated from a particularly zealous member of the local historical society (they were researching a surprisingly active period of Spanish Inquisitions in the 14th century).

Following the debate, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout, with Highways England reporting minimal disruption, although there had been a concerning report of a flock of pigeons attempting to establish a new base camp near the central flyover – a situation the council were diligently monitoring. 

Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves.  A representative from "Dead Parrot Emporium" was present, offering discounted decorative parrots to brighten the stalls, much to the amusement of several attendees.
