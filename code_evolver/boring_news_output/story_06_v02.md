# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Unicorn Sighting

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been observing unusual shimmering activity near the old mill – possibly connected to the rumored sightings of a rogue unicorn, though the council assured him this was “within acceptable parameters” for a village of our standing.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. The work is anticipated to take approximately two days, weather permitting.  A brief inspection by the Ministry of Silly Walks was also noted, ostensibly to check for excessive curvature in the road – a surprisingly common concern amongst the councillors.

Furthermore, a brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week, though there were murmurs that the installation team had briefly abandoned their work to investigate a particularly persistent flock of pigeons – some locals speculated they were messengers from a surprisingly organized Spanish Inquisition.

Finally, the meeting concluded with a discussion regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated, and Councillor Davies reminded everyone that the village’s annual competitive cheese rolling event was fast approaching – a tradition dating back to the 14th century and, according to some, involving knights who consistently responded to requests for clarification with a simple, emphatic “Ni.”
