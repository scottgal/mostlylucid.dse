# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Peculiar Twist

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists – though he did suggest, briefly, that a small dragon might be partially responsible, having apparently taken a liking to the exposed soil. 

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. We’ve had a rather unsettling incident involving a Spanish Inquisition group attempting to determine the authenticity of Mrs. Higgins’ prize-winning marrow – a complete red herring, of course.”

During a brief interlude, a representative from the Ministry of Silly Walks conducted a surprisingly thorough inspection of the meeting room’s flooring, muttering something about “structural instability and the inherent absurdity of bureaucracy.” He was swiftly dismissed, claiming he'd seen a phantom parrot in the village pet shop. 

Following the discussion, the council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project – which, according to Councillor Davies, was “guarded by a particularly stern knight who insists on saying ‘Ni’ when you pass him.”

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information.  A quick note: the local vicar was observed attempting to summon a flock of pigeons using a series of complex mathematical equations – apparently a new hobby.
