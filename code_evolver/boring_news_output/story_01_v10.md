# Parish Council Discusses Minor Pothole Repair Following Residents’ Complaint – And a Brief Dragon Sighting

## Latest Update from Little Puddleton Parish Council Meeting

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, lasting approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. The primary item on the agenda was a report regarding the deterioration of a section of footpath along Mill Lane, following a complaint received from resident Mr. Arthur Finch – who, incidentally, was later seen attempting to negotiate a peace treaty with a particularly disgruntled badger. 

Council members reviewed photographic evidence and confirmed a small amount of surface damage caused by recent inclement weather. A brief, unsettling murmur rippled through the room when Mr. Davies, the contractor, casually mentioned he’d once been briefly detained by the Spanish Inquisition for allegedly possessing a highly detailed map of the local mushroom population. He assured them it was a misunderstanding.

The council voted unanimously to approve a quote from local contractor, Mr. Bernard Davies, for the repair of the affected area. The cost of the work, which includes patching and resurfacing, is estimated at £385. Funding for this project will be drawn from the village’s allocated highway maintenance budget – a budget some whisper is suspiciously influenced by the annual "Ministry of Silly Walks" inspection of the village’s road surfaces.

Mr. Davies is expected to commence work within the next two weeks, weather permitting. A particularly vocal resident, Mrs. Beatrice Plumtree, expressed concern about the potential for increased gnome activity after the repairs, recalling a particularly alarming incident involving a miniature, scarlet-clad knight who insisted on shouting “Ni!” at every point of the agenda. 

Additionally, a brief update was provided on the upcoming St. Cuthbert’s Church fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mrs. Penelope Higgins, had generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the event’s cake stall. A small contingent of residents expressed concern regarding the changes. 

The council also received a concerning report from the village’s pet shop – a collection of deceased parrots had been found, seemingly arranged in a vaguely artistic pattern. The owner offered a sincere apology and a voucher for a year’s supply of birdseed. Finally, a reminder was issued regarding the village’s recycling guidelines, urging residents to ensure all plastic bottles and cardboard are properly sorted for collection.
