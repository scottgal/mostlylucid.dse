# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Basilisk Sighting

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance (and a General Air of Unease)

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also added, almost as an afterthought, that he’d been seeing “fleeting shadows” near the hedgerows, vaguely resembling a juvenile basilisk – though Councillor Higgins dismissed this as likely being caused by the unusually high number of swallows this year.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks. There was a brief, unsettling debate about whether the contractor’s uniforms should include a miniature, symbolic dragon – a nod to the village’s surprisingly rich history of folklore.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – rumour had it a travelling troupe of mime artists were also collecting donations, though their methods were, to say the least, baffling. 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. During the discussion, Councillor Davies nearly shouted “Ni!” which prompted a whispered correction from the Clerk regarding proper parliamentary procedure. 

A brief, but spirited, discussion on the rising cost of rhubarb was also raised, before the meeting adjourned with a collective sigh and a lingering feeling that something wasn’t quite right.
