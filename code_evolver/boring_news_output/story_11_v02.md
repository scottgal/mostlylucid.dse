# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – With a Peculiar Twist

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, predictably dominated by a lengthy discussion regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds – a surprisingly relevant observation, considering the recent reports of miniature, disgruntled dragons attempting to nest in the old clock tower (a matter still under investigation by the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors).

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members. Councillor Arthur Finch suggested a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage – a necessary precaution, he insisted, after a particularly zealous group of knights were observed chanting “Ni” during the previous meeting’s debate on street lighting. 

Several concerns were raised, primarily regarding the potential impact on the existing paving stones. A brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule was given, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion – a task complicated by the occasional appearance of spectral scarecrows. 

The meeting also included a disconcerting, yet entirely unremarkable, update from Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls at the upcoming village fête. She mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that a local historian had unearthed evidence suggesting St. Mary's Square was once the site of a surprisingly brief Spanish Inquisition, though this was dismissed with a shrug. 

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against. A subsequent discussion focused on the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details, though some residents noted a distinct aroma of lavender and disappointment emanating from the proceedings.
