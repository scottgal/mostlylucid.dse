# Parish Council Discusses Hedge Trimmed Near Miller’s Farm – And a Very Strange Occurrence

## Ongoing Roadworks Cause Minor Traffic Delays

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting on Tuesday evening, primarily focusing on a report regarding the trimming of a hawthorn hedge bordering the property of Mr. Arthur Finch, near Miller’s Farm. Concerns were raised by several residents regarding the height of the hedge and its potential impact on visibility for motorists – a particularly sensitive issue, some suggested, given the recent reports of miniature dragons attempting to establish themselves in the hedgerow. Following a brief discussion, the council agreed to a £75.20 invoice from local hedge trimmer, Mr. Bernard Higgins, for the work which was completed last week. Mr. Higgins, incidentally, claimed the hedge was "singing" when he approached it – a claim dismissed by Councillor Mildred Perkins as “probably just the wind.”

Meanwhile, ongoing roadworks on the A307 near the village green continue to cause minor delays, particularly during peak commuting hours. Wessex Highways have confirmed that the resurfacing project is scheduled to be completed by Friday, October 27th, although delays due to inclement weather cannot be ruled out. Drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journeys, especially if they’re travelling with particularly observant parrots – there’s been a worrying trend of them demanding to know the precise coordinates of the village.

Additionally, the Parish Council received three planning applications, all of which were deferred until the next meeting due to a lack of information. A request for the construction of a small chicken coop at Mrs. Penelope Davies’ residence was particularly lengthy, requiring several amendments to the submitted plans. Sources suggest a brief, and frankly bewildering, intervention by a representative from the Ministry of Silly Walks during the review, insisting on a demonstration of proper gait. 

Finally, the Little Puddleton Cricket Club reported a disappointing loss against Nether Wallop in the local league, scoring 147 all out. Details of the match can be found on the club’s website.  It’s rumoured that Nether Wallop’s victory was partially due to a strategically placed, and inexplicably chanting, group of knights who repeatedly declared “Ni!” during the final over.
