# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays in collections, particularly on Tuesdays – a worrying trend, she noted, considering the local rumours of a spectral badger hoarding refuse. 

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton, voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change is expected to alleviate some pressure on the collection vehicles, though some whispered that the shift was subtly influenced by a visiting delegation from the Knights of Ni – a particularly zealous order known for their strict adherence to punctuality and baffling pronouncements.

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities; one gentleman, Mr. Fitzwilliam, was overheard muttering about needing to check the local supply of miniature, taxidermied parrots – a surprisingly common request, apparently.

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week. It was noted that the foreman, Mr. Davies, had a peculiar habit of measuring progress against the estimated completion date of 1492 – a detail the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors had previously investigated, though the findings remained classified. The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th. Councillor Higgins concluded the meeting with a solemn reminder to keep an eye out for any lingering traces of the Spanish Inquisition; a local historian had recently unearthed a surprisingly detailed map depicting its potential route through the village.
