# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – A Most Peculiar Affair

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated by a lengthy discussion regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds – a surprisingly astute observation, given the local rumours of a minor dragon infestation in the nearby orchard. 

The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members, though Councillor Arthur Finch did briefly suggest a temporary protective barrier – citing concerns about potential damage, and a rather unsettling fascination with miniature, perfectly-formed suits of armour.  He also muttered something about “preventing undue influence from the Knights of Ni,” a group known for their surprisingly effective, if baffling, objections to all municipal matters.

Several concerns were raised, primarily regarding the potential impact on the existing paving stones.  A brief, unsettling reminder was given that last year’s Ministry of Silly Walks inspection had flagged excessive cobblestone rolling, and a specialist team had been dispatched to investigate a possible temporal anomaly.  The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion – a task complicated by the occasional spontaneous appearance of deceased parrots in the local pet shop.

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against, after a particularly impassioned plea from a gentleman claiming to be a direct descendant of a 15th-century inquisitor. A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls, and a surprising number of requests for "authentic medieval weaponry" (mostly plastic, thankfully).

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details – and to keep an eye out for any unusually bright butterflies.
