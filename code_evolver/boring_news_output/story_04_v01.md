# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Unicorn Sighting

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists – and, he *strongly* suspected, a breeding ground for miniature, disgruntled griffins. 

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. The aim is to ensure the road is kept safe and tidy for all residents – and to deter any further attempts by the aforementioned griffins.”  A brief, unsettling rumour circulated that a local antique shop had recently acquired a collection of remarkably lifelike dead parrots, which some suspected were connected to the recent increase in reported sightings of shadowy figures near the duck pond.

Following the discussion, the council briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project – a task that, according to Councillor Higgins, involved “a surprisingly complex negotiation with a travelling troupe of knights who insisted on correcting everyone’s pronunciation of ‘Ni’ during the proceedings.”

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information – and to be aware of the Ministry of Silly Walks’ upcoming inspection of the village green.  A brief, almost-silent observation was made by Mr. Davies about a peculiar shimmer near the village well, leading to speculation about a possible temporal anomaly.
