# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Twist

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that he’d been having recurring dreams involving a particularly aggressive badger wielding a miniature catapult – a detail the council politely ignored.

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks. A brief, almost reverent, discussion about the potential for a synchronized swimming team to perform on the A370 during the maintenance period was quickly tabled.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – reportedly, a local historian believes a Roman legionnaire once buried a silver denarius beneath the doorstep, a theory the council acknowledged with a murmured “Interesting.”

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. Councillor Davies, known locally for his staunch opposition to all new construction, was overheard muttering something about "temporal distortions" – a comment attributed by some to a recent visit to the local observatory.
