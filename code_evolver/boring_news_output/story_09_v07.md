# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Possible Unicorn Sighting

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance (and a Persistent Smell of Lavender)

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists. He also mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that he’d seen a rather agitated unicorn sniffing around the rhododendrons – a local legend, he claimed, connected to the 1783 Spanish Inquisition (briefly).

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks. A Ministry of Silly Walks inspector was observed discreetly taking notes, though his precise role remained unclear.

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – rumour has it that a particularly grumpy badger has been attempting to abscond with the donations. 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. Councillor Higgins briefly referenced a particularly vehement argument over a drainage issue from the previous meeting, involving a surprisingly articulate flock of pigeons. Someone also pointed out that the dead parrot in Mrs. Higgins’s pet shop window was exhibiting a distinct lack of interest.  The meeting adjourned with a collective sigh and a mumbled reference to the Knights of Ni.
