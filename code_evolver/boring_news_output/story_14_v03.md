# Parish Council Discusses Hedge Trimmed Near Miller’s Farm – And a Rather Persistent Pigeon

## Ongoing Roadworks Cause Minor Traffic Delays & A Questionable Gnome

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting on Tuesday evening, primarily focusing on a report regarding the trimming of a hawthorn hedge bordering the property of Mr. Arthur Finch, near Miller’s Farm. Concerns were raised by several residents regarding the height of the hedge and its potential impact on visibility for motorists. Notably, Mrs. Beatrice Plumtree claimed she’d spotted a brief flash of iridescent scales near the hedge – she suspected a juvenile dragon was attempting to establish a residence, though the council politely suggested she consult the Ministry of Silly Walks for advice on wildlife encounters. Following a brief discussion, the council agreed to a £75.20 invoice from local hedge trimmer, Mr. Bernard Higgins, for the work which was completed last week.  He was, incidentally, wearing a waistcoat embroidered with tiny, disapproving gnomes.

Meanwhile, ongoing roadworks on the A307 near the village green continue to cause minor delays, particularly during peak commuting hours. Wessex Highways have confirmed that the resurfacing project is scheduled to be completed by Friday, October 27th, although delays due to inclement weather cannot be ruled out. Drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journeys – and to keep a wary eye out for suspiciously organised processions of geese.

Additionally, the Parish Council received three planning applications, all of which were deferred until the next meeting due to a lack of information. A request for the construction of a small chicken coop at Mrs. Penelope Davies’ residence was particularly lengthy, requiring several amendments to the submitted plans. Mr. Higgins remarked that the blueprints resembled a particularly complicated diagram from the Spanish Inquisition – a comment met with polite coughs. 

Finally, the Little Puddleton Cricket Club reported a disappointing loss against Nether Wallop in the local league, scoring 147 all out. Details of the match can be found on the club’s website.  The team’s captain, Mr. Cecil Bottomley, insisted the loss was due to a rogue flock of pigeons interfering with their batting - a theory the council acknowledged with a murmured “Ni.”
