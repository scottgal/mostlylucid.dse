# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design – And Something Else Entirely

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses. Apparently, a visiting delegation from the Ministry of Silly Walks had been observing the meeting, noting the distinct lack of coordinated steps.

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” He then added, almost as an afterthought, that he’d been having increasingly vivid dreams about sentient dandelions demanding equal rights. Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance – a sum rumoured to have been partially funded by a recovered Spanish Inquisition relic. 

Following a brief, and largely unproductive, debate, punctuated by Councillor Higgins’ insistent insistence on “order!”, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. There was a brief, unsettling murmur when a single, perfectly preserved macaw appeared in the back row, reportedly a misplaced exhibit from a particularly zealous ornithological society.  

Mr. Penhaligon also mentioned, while adjusting his spectacles, that he'd received a cryptic postcard from a retired knight who insisted on adding “Ni” to every council decision.  The ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout were reported by Highways England, with minimal disruption – though a team of archaeologists were briefly investigating a small, perfectly circular patch of grass, claiming it was “likely a residual effect of a minor dragon uprising from the late 14th century.” 

Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves.  A particularly large collection of dead parrots was reported to be on sale at Mrs. Higgins’ pet shop – apparently, a trade-in deal.
