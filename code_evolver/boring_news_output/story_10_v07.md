## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Peculiar Twist

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. Apparently, a local dragon – Reginald, a surprisingly well-mannered specimen – had offered a strongly worded critique of the existing colour palette, claiming it "lacked sufficient scale."

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme” and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also noted a suspicious increase in sightings of hooded figures near the village’s ancient well – the local constabulary were reportedly conducting a discreet Ministry of Silly Walks inspection. 

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” She also mentioned that she’d been advised by a travelling Spanish Inquisition about the importance of vibrant hues – a surprisingly pertinent observation, given the recent increase in sightings of elderly gentlemen in cassocks. 

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday.  

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th – featuring a demonstration of competitive pigeon racing. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets. Councillor Higgins was overheard muttering something about a particularly stubborn ball and a possible summoning of a knight who insisted on replying to every query with "Ni." 

Finally, the Clerk reported a new shipment of deceased parrots had arrived at Peterson’s Pet Emporium, a detail seemingly unconnected, yet causing a noticeable ripple of unease amongst the councillors.
