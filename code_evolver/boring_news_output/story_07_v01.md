# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route - With a Slight Temporal Anomaly

## Minor Adjustments Proposed to Recycling Schedule in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, with the primary focus being a discussion regarding alterations to the kerbside recycling collection route. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that several residents had raised concerns about the current schedule, citing perceived delays in collections, particularly on Tuesdays – a time some suspected was attracting the attention of particularly persistent temporal eddies. 

The council, after a lengthy review of the current timetable and the logistical challenges posed by the narrow, winding roads of Little Puddleton (and a surprisingly impassioned plea from Mr. Silas Finch regarding the possible existence of miniature, disgruntled knights who demanded “Ni” at all council meetings), voted to implement a minor adjustment. The collection route will now shift by approximately 30 minutes, with collections commencing at 7:30 am instead of 7:00 am. This change was, according to Councillor Higgins, “designed to mitigate the risk of encountering any residual echoes from the 1492 Spanish Inquisitions – a recurring concern, frankly.”

Furthermore, the council briefly discussed the upcoming Summer Fete, scheduled for July 15th at the village green. Organisers confirmed that local baker, Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, has generously donated a selection of Victoria sponges for the fundraising event. A small number of residents expressed interest in volunteering to assist with the children’s activities – though Mrs. Agatha Plumtree insisted on bringing a meticulously preserved dead parrot from Peterson’s Pet Emporium “as a conversation starter.”

The meeting concluded with a brief update on the ongoing roadworks on Mill Road, with contractors reporting minimal disruption this week. They also noted a peculiar fondness for the Ministry of Silly Walks inspections, apparently driven by the unusually smooth asphalt. The next Parish Council meeting is scheduled for August 9th – and residents are advised to bring their own umbrellas, just in case.
