# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And a Possible Dragon Sighting

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families – including, reportedly, a delegation from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Small, Unexplained Phenomena.

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted, though rumour has it they’ve been conducting preliminary inspections with a miniature, steam-powered velocipede.  We’ve also received a cryptic postcard from a gentleman claiming to be a descendant of Sir Reginald Fitzwilliam, who, according to family lore, briefly served as a knight in the Spanish Inquisition – a very peculiar hobby, he insisted.”

A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services confirmed they’d been observing unusual activity near the church well, suggesting possible involvement of a juvenile dragon, though this remained unconfirmed.  “We’ve seen some… iridescent ripples,” he muttered, nervously adjusting his spectacles. “And there was a rather insistent humming sound.”

The council briefly discussed the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste.  A Ministry of Silly Walks inspection team were present to ensure compliance with the new guidelines - a rather flamboyant gentleman in a striped suit was observed attempting to deposit a banana peel into the recycling bin.

Finally, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out.  A local pet shop reported a significant increase in sales of brightly coloured parrot cages following the match.  “Apparently,” said Mr. Finch, “they’ve been offering a discount to anyone who can accurately identify the number of times someone said ‘Ni’ during the proceedings.”
