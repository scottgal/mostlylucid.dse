# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – No Major Decisions Made (With a Slight Twist)

## Residents Attend Meeting in Little Puddleton, Concerns Raised About Route Efficiency

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, attended by a modest gathering of approximately fifteen residents – including, reportedly, a retired taxidermist who insisted the council investigate a suspicious number of deceased parrots appearing in the local pet shop. The primary item on the agenda was a review of the current kerbside waste collection route, proposed by Councillor Beatrice Higgins. Councillor Higgins argued for a revised schedule to minimize disruption to residents’ access and to optimise collection times, citing anecdotal evidence of residents struggling to access their bins on certain days. She did, however, briefly mention a local rumour about a badger who’d been seen attempting to negotiate a trade with the council for a particularly fine collection of acorns – a claim dismissed with a polite cough by Councillor Davies.

Following a brief discussion – punctuated by a rather agitated discussion about the potential for a small, localised Spanish Inquisition (apparently linked to a misplaced recycling bin), – the council voted to commission a short survey from local waste management company, Green Solutions Ltd, to assess the current route's efficiency. The survey will focus on identifying areas of congestion and potential bottlenecks. Several residents voiced concerns regarding the potential impact of the changes, primarily regarding the timing of collections and the impact on access for elderly residents. One resident, Mr. Silas Peabody, stated he'd been having recurring dreams involving a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector and a particularly stubborn wheelie bin. 

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming village fete, scheduled for July 15th, and a reminder to residents to register for the new recycling scheme, which is due to be implemented next month. The fete committee confirmed that the bake sale will be raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, and a raffle will be held. No decisions were made regarding the planning application for a new garden shed on Mr. Harold Finch’s property – though Councillor Higgins did point out that Mr. Finch's cat, Bartholomew, had a surprisingly intense interest in architectural planning.
