# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” However, the proposal met with considerable resistance from several members of the public.

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot, muttering something about “a particularly aggressive strain – we had a brief, unfortunate incident with a miniature dragon last year, you know, demanding fertilizer.” He suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender. Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies, adding with a shiver, "It’s not just the pollen, you know. There’s something…unnatural about the way the bees are buzzing."

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues,” a statement that seemed to echo the pronouncements of the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors who had recently conducted a routine assessment of the village’s general ambiance. The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th. 

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular – reportedly, a small delegation of retired knights were observed at the sale, frequently interjecting with the impassioned cry of “Ni!” during discussions about jam quantities. The air even carried a faint scent of rosemary and incense, a lingering reminder of the brief, and thankfully contained, Spanish Inquisition that the village had experienced in 1887.
