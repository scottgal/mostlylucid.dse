# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Slight Dragon Sighting

## Ongoing Work Scheduled for Willow Creek Lane

Willow Creek, Oxfordshire – The Willow Creek Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, primarily focused on a complaint regarding the condition of the verges along Willow Creek Lane. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of number 14, raised concerns regarding the amount of accumulated gravel and loose stones, stating that it posed a potential hazard to cyclists and motorists. He also mentioned, rather casually, that he’d been observing a rather agitated badger exhibiting signs of what he suspected was a nascent, though admittedly unconvincing, ambition to run for mayor.

Following Mr. Finch’s report, the council agreed to schedule a supplementary verge maintenance operation. Councillor Margaret Davies confirmed that Oxfordshire County Council’s Highways Department had been notified and a team were expected to begin work on Tuesday, October 24th. Apparently, a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection team had been dispatched to assess the road surface – they’d left after a particularly vigorous wobble. 

A brief update was provided on the ongoing refurbishment of the village’s playground, funded by a small grant from the local community fundraising group, ‘Friends of Willow Creek’. The council confirmed that the new climbing frame is due to be installed next week, though a small contingent of villagers remained convinced it was being built by a retired Spanish Inquisition member. 

Furthermore, a brief discussion followed regarding the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, scheduled for Saturday, November 4th, to raise funds for the village hall’s roof repairs. A sign-up sheet for volunteers was circulated, alongside a single, unsettlingly realistic dead parrot from Mr. Higgins’ pet shop. 

During a lull, Councillor Davies recalled a local legend – a spectral knight, Sir Reginald “Ni” Featherstonehaugh, was said to appear at council meetings, vehemently objecting to any proposals involving the use of commas. The team were also keenly aware of reports of a travelling circus – a small, bewildered troupe of llamas – setting up camp near the river.  It's a very peculiar place to hold a meeting, really.
