# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Design

## New Plans for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Face Resistance

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the proposed redesign of the flower bed outside the village hall. Councillor Beatrice Higgins presented a design featuring predominantly pink roses, citing their “classic beauty” and “positive association with community spirit.” Witnesses reported a brief, unsettling sighting of a miniature dragon briefly attempting to run for mayor before being politely escorted away by a constable.

However, the proposal met with considerable resistance from several members of the public. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a long-time resident and keen gardener, raised concerns about the rose’s susceptibility to blackspot and suggested a more hardy alternative, such as lavender. He was overheard muttering about “temporal distortions affecting bloom cycles.” Mrs. Doris Finch, who lives adjacent to the proposed location, expressed worries about the potential for increased pollen affecting her allergies. She also mentioned a recent, frankly bizarre, Spanish Inquisition-style investigation into the local butcher’s chorizo recipe.

Councillor Higgins defended the rose design, stating that “appropriate measures would be taken to mitigate any potential issues,” adding, somewhat cryptically, “We’ve consulted with the Ministry of Silly Walks regarding structural stability.” The council ultimately voted to table the decision, requesting a professional horticultural consultation to assess the suitability of the proposed roses and explore alternative planting options. A brief, uncomfortable silence followed, punctuated only by the sound of a particularly vigorous “Ni” being uttered by a council member during a discussion about drainage.

Following the meeting, the Little Puddleton Community Bake Sale, raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, continued to attract a modest but steady stream of customers. Sales of Victoria sponge were particularly popular – some locals claimed the sponge possessed an uncanny ability to predict the weather. A dead parrot was spotted in Mr. Henderson’s pet shop, sparking a mild panic amongst the younger residents. A representative from the Department of Unusual Flora was briefly called in to assess the situation. 

A revised proposal is expected to be presented at the next meeting, scheduled for July 18th.
