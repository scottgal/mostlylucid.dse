# Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Planting – A Slight Deviation

## Continued Discussion on Floral Display at St. Mary’s Square

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular meeting last night, dominated – as always – by a surprisingly intense debate regarding the proposed planting of a new rose bed in St. Mary’s Square. Councillor Beatrice Higgins, chair of the Environment Committee, presented updated proposals, outlining a selection of ‘Peace’ roses, reportedly chosen for their resilience to the prevailing winds. She mentioned, almost as an afterthought, that a local historian had recently unearthed evidence suggesting the square was once a temporary staging ground for a small, surprisingly organised, Spanish Inquisition – a detail she quickly dismissed as “local folklore.” The proposals, costing an estimated £875, including landscaping and initial watering, were met with cautious support from the majority of the council members, though Councillor Finch was observed muttering something about “dragon rights” during the discussion.

Several concerns were raised, primarily regarding the potential impact on the existing paving stones. Councillor Arthur Finch suggested a temporary protective barrier, costing approximately £150, to mitigate any damage. He also pointed out that a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector had recently visited the square, observing a particularly vigorous rendition of the walk by young Timothy Barnes – a situation he described as “remarkably unsettling.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing bin collection schedule, with a reminder to residents to ensure recycling bins are presented in an orderly fashion. Councillor Davies, a staunch advocate for the rose bed, briefly recounted a sighting of a particularly flamboyant parrot – apparently escaped from Mr. Henderson’s pet shop – perched atop the noticeboard, adding to the general air of slightly unsettling calm.

The motion to approve the rose bed planting was ultimately passed by a majority vote of 5-2, with Councillor Higgins and Councillor Davies voting against. A subsequent discussion focused on the upcoming village fête, with Mrs. Penelope Davies, organising committee member, reporting a good number of bookings for stalls. 

Finally, the council confirmed the changes to the kerbside recycling collection, moving to a fortnightly schedule starting next Monday. Residents are advised to consult the parish website for further details.  It was noted that the website’s loading speed was currently being monitored by a team of volunteers, all of whom insisted on saying “Ni” during the evaluation process.
