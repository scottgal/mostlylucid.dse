## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Peculiar Twist

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. Apparently, a local historian had recently unearthed a scroll detailing a rather passionate dispute from 1688 involving a rogue unicorn and the original colour scheme – something about "unacceptable chromatic dissonance.”

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums "provided a robust and reliable colour scheme" and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also noted, somewhat distractedly, that the local badger population had been exhibiting unusually rhythmic behaviour lately, possibly linked to the change. 

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” She also casually mentioned a sighting of a small, shimmering dragon attempting to negotiate a reduced parking fee at the village shop – a matter currently under investigation by the Ministry of Silly Walks. 

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday. A representative from the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. 

The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets. Mr. Finch was overheard muttering something about needing to commission a spectral analysis of the cricket pitch – a rumour circulating that the ground was occasionally haunted by disgruntled 18th-century botanists.
