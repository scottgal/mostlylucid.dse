# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design – And a Slight Temporal Anomaly

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses – a surprisingly complex undertaking given the recent reports of minor temporal distortions affecting the vicarage (apparently, someone left the grandfather clock running backwards for a week).

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” He then added, somewhat cryptically, that he’d once seen a unicorn attempting to pay his council tax with a single, perfect daffodil – a detail he insisted was entirely relevant. Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance. A brief, and largely unproductive, debate ensued, punctuated by a sudden, unsettling silence as Mrs. Beatrice Chumley-Brown swore she’d detected the faint scent of paprika and brimstone.

Following the discussion, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. The meeting also included a brief update on the ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout, with Highways England reporting minimal disruption – though a team of Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors were reportedly observing the traffic flow, convinced it was a complex semaphore system. 

Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves. Councillor Higgins concluded by mentioning, almost as an afterthought, that she’d recently received a strongly worded letter from a gentleman claiming his prize-winning marrow had been abducted by a travelling troupe of Spanish Inquisitors.
