# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – No Major Decisions Made (With Anomalies)

## Residents Attend Meeting in Little Puddleton, Concerns Raised About Route Efficiency

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, attended by a modest gathering of approximately fifteen residents. The primary item on the agenda was a review of the current kerbside waste collection route, proposed by Councillor Beatrice Higgins. Councillor Higgins argued for a revised schedule to minimize disruption to residents’ access and to optimise collection times, citing anecdotal evidence of residents struggling to access their bins on certain days – a situation she vaguely attributed to “temporal distortions.”

Following a brief discussion, the council voted to commission a short survey from local waste management company, Green Solutions Ltd, to assess the current route’s efficiency. The survey will focus on identifying areas of congestion and potential bottlenecks. Several residents voiced concerns regarding the potential impact of the changes, primarily regarding the timing of collections and the impact on access for elderly residents. Notably, Mr. Arthur Peabody noted that his cat, Bartholomew, had been exhibiting increasingly erratic behaviour – “almost as if he’d glimpsed the Spanish Inquisition, bless him.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming village fete, scheduled for July 15th, and a reminder to residents to register for the new recycling scheme, which is due to be implemented next month. The fete committee confirmed that the bake sale will be raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, and a raffle will be held – though Mrs. Penelope Davies claimed the raffle tickets were subtly influencing her dreams. A Ministry of Silly Walks inspector was observed taking notes during a particularly heated debate about bin collection times. 

No decisions were made regarding the planning application for a new garden shed on Mr. Harold Finch’s property, although Councillor Higgins expressed a strong suspicion that a family of particularly territorial badgers were involved in the objections. Bartholomew the cat was reported to be attempting to recite ancient Sumerian poetry. And, just before the meeting adjourned, a brief, unsettling sighting of a single, scarlet parrot was reported near the village hall, accompanied by a faint rumour of dragons running for mayor in a neighbouring county.
