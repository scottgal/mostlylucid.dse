just# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists – a particularly alarming prospect given the recent sightings of miniature dragons attempting to run for mayor, although the local constabulary assured residents they were merely “a bit enthusiastic.”

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget – a sum that, according to Councillor Higgins, was roughly equivalent to the annual cost of the Ministry of Silly Walks inspections. 

A brief, unsettling pause followed when Councillor Davies muttered something about “unforeseen temporal anomalies” during a discussion on drainage, before swiftly moving on.  Mr. Penhaligon, noticing the concerned glances, quickly added, “It’s just a bit damp, really.”

A report was received from the village’s recycling officer, Mr. David Finch, detailing a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, and the council agreed to support this initiative.  The council also briefly considered commissioning a team of historical reenactors to demonstrate the proper disposal of unwanted parchment – a suggestion swiftly dismissed after a particularly vehement argument about the potential for spontaneous Spanish Inquisitions.

Finally, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund. A dead parrot was spotted in Mr. Peterson’s pet shop, but the shopkeeper insisted it was a “particularly poignant piece of avian art.”
