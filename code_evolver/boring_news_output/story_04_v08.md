# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And a Slight Anomaly

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Conditions in Little Puddleton

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on the continued maintenance of the A372 verge along Mill Road. The discussion was prompted by a formal complaint submitted by Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the accumulation of weeds and debris – reportedly including a small, disgruntled gnome. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Close, stated that the overgrown verge was a potential hazard for cyclists and motorists, although witnesses claimed to have seen a brief flash of emerald green near the hedgerow – possibly a misplaced dragon scouting for roadkill.

Councillor Beatrice Finch, chair of the meeting, confirmed that the Highways Department had been notified and were scheduled to undertake a clearance operation within the next two weeks. “We receive several similar complaints each year,” she stated, “and we take them very seriously. We’ve had a few instances of unusually aggressive badger behaviour lately, too, so vigilance is key.”  The council briefly debated the potential for a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the verge – Councillor Higgins insisted it was “essential for maintaining public order.”

Following the discussion, the council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Harvest Festival bake sale, organised by the Little Puddleton Women’s Institute, scheduled for Saturday, October 28th. Proceeds will be donated to the village hall refurbishment project, which, rumour had it, was partly funded by a recovered Spanish Inquisition artifact (a rather dusty rosary). 

Finally, the minutes of the previous meeting were formally approved, and a reminder was issued regarding the changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, effective November 1st. Residents are advised to check the parish council website for detailed information.  Someone also inquired about the possibility of a formal apology being issued to the local collection of dead parrots at ‘Pet Paradise’ - a matter apparently raised by a particularly passionate ornithologist.  A brief, unsettling silence fell as Councillor Finch mentioned the scheduled arrival of a delegation from the Department of Unusual Phenomena to observe the meeting, simply to “ensure everything remains… normal.”
