# Parish Council Faces Heated Debate Over Rose Bed Design – With a Minor Unicorn Incident

## New Designs for St. Cuthbert’s Garden Spark Controversy

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and the primary point of discussion was the proposed redesign of the rose bed in St. Cuthbert’s Garden, adjacent to the village hall. Councillor Mildred Higgins, chair of the committee, presented three alternative designs, all featuring a variety of hybrid tea roses. Apparently, someone reported a minor unicorn sighting near the rose bushes earlier that week – a detail quickly dismissed by Mr. Davies, who insisted it was simply a particularly flamboyant sheep.

The designs, submitted by local landscaping firm, ‘Green Thumb Solutions,’ were met with a largely muted response from the attending residents. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Meadow Lane, raised concerns regarding the colour palette, stating that “the predominantly pink varieties were, frankly, a touch overwhelming.” He added, almost as an afterthought, that he’d once witnessed a brief, and unsettling, Spanish Inquisition attempting to recover a misplaced trowel. Others expressed reservations about the cost, estimated at £875, including installation and ongoing maintenance – a figure that prompted Councillor Peterson to mutter something about the Ministry of Silly Walks inspectors.

Following a brief, and largely unproductive, debate, the council voted to table the decision for two weeks, requesting a further cost analysis and a wider consultation with local gardeners. A brief update on the ongoing repairs to the A303 roundabout was provided by Highways England, reporting minimal disruption – though one attendee swore he saw a faint glimmer of armour suggesting a possible phantom knight was still overseeing the project. 

Finally, the Parish Council confirmed that the annual village fete will take place on July 15th, with a raffle and stalls offering homemade cakes and preserves. The fete committee also revealed they’d commissioned a particularly realistic, but ultimately deceased, parrot to be the mascot – a decision met with varying degrees of agreement and horrified silence.
