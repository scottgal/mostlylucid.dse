# Parish Council Discusses Bin Collection Route – No Major Decisions Made (With Minor Anomalies)

## Residents Attend Meeting in Little Puddleton, Concerns Raised About Route Efficiency

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the village hall, attended by a modest gathering of approximately fifteen residents. The primary item on the agenda was a review of the current kerbside waste collection route, proposed by Councillor Beatrice Higgins. Councillor Higgins argued for a revised schedule to minimize disruption to residents’ access and to optimise collection times, citing anecdotal evidence of residents struggling to access their bins on certain days – a surprisingly common occurrence, apparently, given the recent reports of miniature, territorial dragons nesting in the hedgerows.

Following a brief discussion, the council voted to commission a short survey from local waste management company, Green Solutions Ltd, to assess the current route's efficiency. The survey will focus on identifying areas of congestion and potential bottlenecks. Several residents voiced concerns regarding the potential impact of the changes, primarily regarding the timing of collections and the impact on access for elderly residents. One gentleman, Mr. Percival Grimshaw, insisted that the collection schedule was “clearly influenced by the cyclical movements of the astral plane” – a suggestion met with a polite, if bewildered, nod from Councillor Higgins.

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming village fete, scheduled for July 15th, and a reminder to residents to register for the new recycling scheme, which is due to be implemented next month. The fete committee confirmed that the bake sale will be raising funds for the village hall refurbishment, and a raffle will be held – though rumour has it that a prize of a perfectly preserved, slightly judgmental, macaw will be up for grabs. No decisions were made regarding the planning application for a new garden shed on Mr. Harold Finch’s property, though witnesses reported observing a Ministry of Silly Walks inspector meticulously examining the proposed location, muttering about “structural integrity and the potential for spontaneous combustion.” 

A brief, unsettling pause followed when a local resident, Mrs. Agatha Plumtree, announced she’d found a surprisingly well-maintained, albeit slightly accusing, dead parrot in her pet shop window.  Councillor Higgins simply stated, "Ni," before moving on.
