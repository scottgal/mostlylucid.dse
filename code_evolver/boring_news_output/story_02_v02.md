# Parish Council Discusses Minor Drainage Issues at St. Cuthbert’s Church Fete – And a Possible Unicorn Sighting

## Residents Raise Concerns Over Puddles Following Heavy Rainfall

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, primarily focusing on a report regarding drainage issues surrounding St. Cuthbert’s Church, which hosted its annual Summer Fete yesterday. Attendance was reported as “steady” with an estimated 180 attendees, primarily local residents and families – including, reportedly, a gentleman claiming to be a direct descendant of Merlin, though his claims regarding dragon-related land ownership were swiftly dismissed. 

Councillor Marjorie Higgins noted that several complaints had been received concerning puddles forming around the church grounds following the recent heavy rainfall. “The situation is, shall we say, damp,” she stated. “A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services has been contacted to assess the problem and provide a preliminary report. We’ve also had a rather insistent inquiry about the possibility of installing a miniature Roman aqueduct – apparently, some believe it would ‘harmonize with the local aura.’"

A representative from Willow Creek Drainage Services confirmed they’d encountered a small, remarkably well-organized colony of frogs near the south wall, and suggested they were “possibly sentient” – a suggestion met with a murmured “Ni” from Councillor Bertram Finch.

The council briefly discussed the upcoming changes to the kerbside recycling collection schedule, scheduled to come into effect next Monday. Residents are being advised to familiarize themselves with the new guidelines, which will see a shift to fortnightly collections for general waste.  A brief, unsettling discussion arose regarding the potential for a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the recycling bins, though this was quickly tabled.

Finally, the results of the village cricket match against Upper Bampton were announced: Upper Bampton won by 63 runs. Little Puddleton scored 142 all out.  The captain of the Little Puddleton team was overheard muttering about the possibility of summoning a spectral cricket to bat – a suggestion which, unsurprisingly, was met with polite skepticism.  The Parish Council adjourned, noting that a single, iridescent feather had been spotted near the rose bushes – a detail currently under investigation by the local ornithological society, and a gentleman who insisted it was proof of a recent, though thankfully brief, Spanish Inquisition.
