# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists. 

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget. Councillor Margaret Higgins, chair of the meeting, noted that this was one of several minor maintenance issues currently being addressed across the parish. 

Furthermore, a report was received from the village’s recycling officer, Mr. David Finch, detailing a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, and the council agreed to support this initiative. 

Finally, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund.
