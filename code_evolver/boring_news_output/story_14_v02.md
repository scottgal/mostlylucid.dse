# Parish Council Discusses Hedge Trimmed Near Miller’s Farm – And Briefly Considered the Fate of a Particularly Grumpy Goose

## Ongoing Roadworks Cause Minor Traffic Delays

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting on Tuesday evening, primarily focusing on a report regarding the trimming of a hawthorn hedge bordering the property of Mr. Arthur Finch, near Miller’s Farm. Concerns were raised by several residents regarding the height of the hedge and its potential impact on visibility for motorists. Councillor Mildred Periwinkle noted a peculiar scent lingering near the hedge – “almost reminiscent of a minor Spanish Inquisition, though considerably less dramatic.” Following a brief discussion, the council agreed to a £75.20 invoice from local hedge trimmer, Mr. Bernard Higgins, for the work which was completed last week. He also mentioned he’d had a brief conversation with a badger about the state of the local flora - a surprisingly insightful dialogue, he claimed.

Meanwhile, ongoing roadworks on the A307 near the village green continue to cause minor delays, particularly during peak commuting hours. Wessex Highways have confirmed that the resurfacing project is scheduled to be completed by Friday, October 27th, although delays due to inclement weather cannot be ruled out. Drivers are advised to allow extra time for their journeys. Apparently, a team from the Ministry of Silly Walks conducted a surprise inspection of the traffic management signage – a truly bewildering experience, according to witnesses.

Additionally, the Parish Council received three planning applications, all of which were deferred until the next meeting due to a lack of information. A request for the construction of a small chicken coop at Mrs. Penelope Davies’ residence was particularly lengthy, requiring several amendments to the submitted plans. It was rumoured she’d commissioned a miniature suit of armour for her prize-winning Rhode Island Red, Henrietta.

Finally, the Little Puddleton Cricket Club reported a disappointing loss against Nether Wallop in the local league, scoring 147 all out. Details of the match can be found on the club’s website.  The captain, Mr. Cecil Bumble, was overheard muttering about the possibility of recruiting a team of knights, though he admitted their battle cries were largely limited to "Ni."
