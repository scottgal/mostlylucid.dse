# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – With a Few Anomalies

## Little Puddleton Residents Raise Concerns Over Roadside Appearance

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, where the primary item on the agenda was a complaint regarding the state of the verges along the A370. Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, a resident of Willow Creek Lane, formally raised concerns about the accumulation of weeds and general disrepair, stating that it was “an eyesore” and potentially hazardous to cyclists – though he did mutter something about a brief sighting of a miniature dragon near the hedgerow, which the Clerk assured everyone was "simply a particularly flamboyant butterfly."

Following Mr. Penhaligon’s report, councillors discussed the issue, with Councillor Beatrice Higgins noting that the Highways Department had been notified on the 14th of July. She confirmed that a preliminary inspection had been carried out on the 28th, and a schedule for verge maintenance had been drafted. This schedule, costing an estimated £385, will be undertaken by Balfour Beatty over the course of the next two weeks – a surprisingly efficient operation, considering the rumours circulating about their ongoing ‘Ni’ saying habit at council meetings. 

The council also briefly touched upon the upcoming Village Fete, scheduled for the 12th of August, and confirmed that the fundraising target of £800 for the local children’s ward at the Royal Bourne Hospital remains unfulfilled. A collection tin will be placed outside the Village Shop – allegedly guarded by a particularly judgmental parrot.  Someone mentioned a brief, historical incident involving a Spanish Inquisition in the village archives, but the Clerk swiftly dismissed it as "local folklore."

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a single-storey garage at 14 Primrose Way was deferred until the next meeting due to concerns regarding potential impact on neighbouring properties. Councillor Davies observed that the proposed design resembled a Ministry of Silly Walks inspection, and suggested a more… aerodynamic solution.  A representative from the Highways Department briefly mentioned a scheduled audit by the Department of Unusual Phenomena, just in case.
