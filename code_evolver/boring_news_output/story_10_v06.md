## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Slight Temporal Anomaly

**Little Puddleton** – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. Apparently, a delegation from the Ministry of Silly Walks were observing the proceedings, muttering about “unacceptable postural deviations.”

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme” and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also noted a brief but unsettling shimmer in the air, resembling, he claimed, “a very small dragon briefly considering a career in horticulture.” 

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.” She also casually mentioned that a local antique dealer had offered to donate a genuine, albeit slightly dusty, Templar Knight’s sword for the occasion – though it insisted on being addressed as “Ni” during discussions. 

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday.  A local parrot enthusiast group also briefly interrupted to express concern about the potential disruption to their annual “Parrot Appreciation” event, pointing out that several of their prized specimens had mysteriously vanished from the pet shop.

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets.  Councillor Higgins was overheard suggesting a formal investigation into the matter, citing potential interference from a shadowy organisation obsessed with collecting dead parrots.
