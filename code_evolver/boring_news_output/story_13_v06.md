# Little Puddleton Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance – And a Few Other Things

## Ongoing Discussions Regarding Roadside Vegetation

Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night at the Village Hall, with the primary topic of discussion being the continued maintenance of the verges along the A374. Councillor Beatrice Higgins reported that the recent rainfall had exacerbated the issue of overgrown weeds and brambles, significantly reducing visibility for motorists. Apparently, a local badger clan had been conducting a series of elaborate, if slightly unsettling, territorial markings – possibly related to the recent uptick in sightings of miniature, iridescent dragons (though the Wiltshire Council insisted it was merely “atmospheric refraction”).

“It’s a persistent problem, really,” Councillor Higgins stated. “We’ve contacted Wiltshire Council regarding the responsibility for the work, but they’ve indicated that they’re currently operating under budget constraints. We’ve requested a further assessment and a timeline for action, but no firm commitments have been made as yet. Last week, we had a brief inspection by the Ministry of Silly Walks – a truly bewildering experience.”

The meeting also included a brief update on the upcoming St. Michael’s Church Fete, scheduled for July 15th. Organisers confirmed that donations for the raffle were still being gratefully received, and urged residents to support the event, which promises to feature a bake sale and a tombola. A contingent of villagers were overheard discussing the possibility of a local Spanish Inquisition to deal with the rising complaints about excessive bunting. 

Finally, a planning application for the construction of a small storage shed adjacent to the Old Mill was discussed. The application, submitted by Mr. Arthur Finch, was deferred until the next meeting to allow for further consideration of drainage concerns. During the discussion, a knight was observed standing up and declaring "Ni!" before returning to his seat, much to the amusement of the tea ladies.  The meeting concluded with a vote to approve the continued use of the Village Hall’s tea-making facilities – a decision reportedly influenced by the presence of a remarkably lifelike, though slightly judgmental, dead parrot in the window of Mrs. Miggins’ Pet Emporium.
