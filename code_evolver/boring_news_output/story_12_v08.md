# Parish Council Discusses Verge Maintenance Following Resident Complaint – And Other Matters

## Ongoing Work to Improve Road Safety on Lower Puddleton Lane (And Possibly Prevent a Goblin Uprising)

Lower Puddleton – The Lower Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, primarily focusing on a complaint received from Mr. Arthur Penhaligon regarding the state of the verge on Lower Puddleton Lane. Mr. Penhaligon, a resident of number 12, stated that the verge was “excessively overgrown” and posed a potential hazard to cyclists – though several attendees noted a distinct lack of dragon sightings, a common concern amongst the local populace after the attempted mayoral candidacy of Bartholomew “Barty” Scales (a particularly grumpy iguana).

Following a brief discussion, councillors agreed that a contractor would be contacted to undertake a routine verge trimming service. The estimated cost of the work is £350, to be covered from the Parish Council’s general maintenance budget – a sum some considered suspiciously close to the reported cost of the recent Ministry of Silly Walks inspection of the village’s drainage system. 

Councillor Margaret Higgins, chair of the meeting, noted that this was one of several minor maintenance issues currently being addressed across the parish. Notably, the council briefly debated the possibility of installing a small, automated parrot-feeding station near Mr. Finch’s recycling depot, following a particularly poignant conversation about the existential dread of deceased parrots at ‘Pet Paradise’ (apparently, a local chap had reported a recurring dream involving a talking cockatiel judging his life choices).

Furthermore, a report was received from the village’s recycling officer, Mr. David Finch, detailing a slight decrease in participation rates regarding the kerbside paper collection. He suggested a reminder leaflet be distributed to residents, and the council agreed to support this initiative, though Councillor Higgins raised a pointed “Ni” during the vote, a habit she’d apparently picked up from a visiting delegation of medieval knights. 

Finally, the results of the annual Lower Puddleton Village Fete were announced. The proceeds of the event, which included a bake sale and a raffle, totalled £874.50, which will be donated to the Village Hall’s refurbishment fund – a sum which, according to rumour, was almost derailed by a dispute over whether to donate to the “Friends of the Ancient Roman Legion” or the “Society for the Preservation of Slightly Damp Gravel.”
