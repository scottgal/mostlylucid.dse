## Parish Council Debate Over Rose Bed Colour Continues – With a Side of Temporal Anomalies

**Little Puddleton –** The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its regular monthly meeting last night, with the primary topic of discussion revolving around a proposed redesign of the floral display on the village green. Councillor Arthur Finch, Chair of the meeting, opened proceedings by outlining the intention to replace the existing red geraniums with a paler shade of pink. He was, incidentally, observed muttering about a particularly stubborn gnome he’d encountered whilst inspecting the rose beds – a recurring issue amongst local council members, apparently linked to an unexplained surge in miniature territorial disputes.

The proposal, put forward by Councillor Beatrice Higgins, was met with considerable debate. Mr. Finch expressed concerns regarding the aesthetic impact, stating that the current red geraniums “provided a robust and reliable colour scheme” and that a paler shade might “dilute the overall visual appeal.” He also noted, somewhat cryptically, that the original geraniums had been exhibiting signs of temporal displacement – flickering slightly when viewed through a certain antique magnifying glass. 

Ms. Higgins countered, arguing that the new pink variety was “more in keeping with current trends” and “would create a more modern look.”  She was overheard saying something about a delegation of Spanish Inquisitors who’d requested a demonstration of the new colour palette – a rather odd request, given their historical interests. 

Following a lengthy discussion, a vote was taken, resulting in a 4-3 decision to proceed with the change. The new pink geraniums are scheduled to be installed by Little Puddleton Gardening Supplies next Tuesday.  A Ministry of Silly Walks inspector was present, documenting the entire proceedings with a meticulousness that bordered on the obsessive. 

Additionally, the Council confirmed that the village’s recycling collection schedule will remain unchanged, and the annual Church Fete will be held on July 15th. The results of the recent village cricket match against Upper Crumpington were also announced: Upper Crumpington won by 4 wickets. A local pet shop was reportedly displaying a collection of unusually deceased parrots, a detail noted by Councillor Finch, who suggested they might be connected to the temporal disturbances.  The meeting concluded with a brief, awkward silence as a knight, inexplicably wearing a helmet and shouting "Ni!" left the room.
