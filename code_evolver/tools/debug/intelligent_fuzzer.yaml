type: "executable"
description: |
  Advanced fuzzing tool that finds edge cases and breaks functions by feeding them
  malformed, adversarial, and edge-case inputs. Inspired by Hypothesis and Atheris.

  Features:
  - Type-aware fuzzing based on function signatures
  - Mutation-based fuzzing from valid inputs
  - Grammar-based fuzzing for structured data
  - Adversarial fuzzing (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, command injection)
  - Boundary value analysis
  - Coverage-guided fuzzing
  - Crash detection and reproduction
  - Automatic test case generation from failures

  Strategies:
  - Random: Pure random data generation
  - Type-aware: Based on type hints
  - Mutation: Mutate valid inputs
  - Grammar: Grammar-based structured data
  - Boundary: Test boundary values (0, max, min, inf, nan, etc.)
  - Adversarial: Known attack patterns

  Use for:
  - Finding edge cases in tools
  - Security testing (injection vulnerabilities)
  - Mutation testing optimization
  - Generating comprehensive unit tests
  - Regression testing
  - Property-based testing

  Outputs:
  - Crash reports with stack traces
  - Unique crash categorization
  - Input reproduction cases
  - Auto-generated pytest test cases
  - Coverage analysis
