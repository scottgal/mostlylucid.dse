  ## Usage Tracking Disabled

  This tool has `track_usage: false` because it's an internal testing tool.
  It won't increment usage counters in RAG.

  **Use this pattern for:**
  - Internal testing tools
  - Debugging/diagnostic tools
  - Temporary/experimental tools
  - Tools you don't want in usage analytics

  ## Example

  ```python
  # This call won't be tracked
  result = call_tool("internal_test_validator", json.dumps({
      "test_output": "some output",
      "expected_pattern": "success"
  }))
  # No usage counter incremented, no timestamp updated
  ```

  ## Production Tools

  Production tools should have `track_usage: true` (or omit it, true is default).
  This helps track:
  - Which tools are popular
  - Version adoption rates
  - Lineage effectiveness
