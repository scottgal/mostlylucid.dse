examples:
  - "Generate tests for calculator module with 60 second timeout"
  - "Create pytest tests for data_processor.py with high coverage"
  - "Quick test generation for newly created functions"
  - "Automated test suite generation during code evolution"

use_cases:
  - "First-line test generation during code creation"
  - "Quick coverage baseline before manual test refinement"
  - "Regression test suite generation"
  - "Edge case discovery through evolutionary testing"
  - "Initial test scaffold for new modules"

advantages:
  - "Very fast (typically completes in under 60 seconds)"
  - "No manual test writing required"
  - "High code coverage automatically"
  - "Discovers edge cases through mutation analysis"
  - "Generates valid pytest code"
  - "Free and open source"

limitations:
  - "Generated tests may need manual refinement"
  - "Assertion quality varies"
  - "May not understand complex business logic"
  - "Requires installable Python module"
  - "Best for pure functions, struggles with I/O and side effects"

workflow_integration:
  position: "first-line"
  trigger: "after code generation"
  next_step: "review and refine tests with LLM if needed"
  fallback: "Use LLM-based test generation if Pynguin fails"
