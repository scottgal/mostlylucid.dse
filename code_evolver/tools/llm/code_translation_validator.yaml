  prompt_template: "Validate this translated code:\n\n{translated_code}\n\nCheck:\n1. Python syntax is still valid\n2. Only comments were translated (not keywords, variables, functions)\n3. Code structure is unchanged\n4. No code keywords mistranslated (def, class, import, if, for, etc.)\n\nRespond with:\n- 'OK' if code is valid\n- 'ERROR: <list of issues>' if problems found\n\nBe concise (under 100 tokens)."
