# General Code Generator
# Backend-agnostic tool that references the "base" model role

name: "General Code Generator"
type: "llm"
description: "General purpose code generation for any programming task. Used as fallback when no specialized tool matches. Handles complex logic, multi-step workflows, and sophisticated algorithms."

# Performance characteristics
cost_tier: "medium"
speed_tier: "fast"
quality_tier: "excellent"
max_output_length: "very-long"

# LLM configuration
llm:
  # Can use either tier-based or role-based (for backward compatibility)
  tier: "coding.tier_2"  # Tiered system (preferred)
  role: "base"           # Legacy role system (fallback)

  system_prompt: |
    You are an expert software engineer. Write clean, efficient, well-documented code following best practices.

    IMPORTANT: For content generation tasks (stories, articles, jokes), write Python code that DIRECTLY creates the content as a string in the main() function. DO NOT use call_tool().

    Priority: {priority}
    Quality expectation: {quality_level}
    Speed requirement: {speed_requirement}

  prompt_template: |
    Generate code for the following task:

    {task}

    Workflow Context:
    - Priority: {priority} (determines speed vs quality tradeoff)
    - Quality level: {quality_level} (draft/good/production/perfect)
    - Speed: {speed_requirement} (fast/balanced/thorough)

    For content generation tasks:
    - Write a simple main() function that DIRECTLY creates the content
    - DO NOT use call_tool() - that function doesn't exist in the runtime
    - Just create the content as a string variable and output it
