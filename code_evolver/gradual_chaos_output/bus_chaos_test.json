The changes, effective Monday, October 23rd, represent a largely cosmetic tweak, primarily impacting the 8:15 to Market Harborough service. \n\nAccording to a statement released by Willow Creek, the alteration is due to “ongoing driver recruitment challenges” and a “slight reduction in passenger numbers during the early morning commute.” Specifically, the 8:15 now departs 15 minutes later, arriving in Market Harborough at 9:30, rather than 9:15. \n\nLocal pensioner, Mr. Bartholomew Higgins, commented, \"Well, it's a shame, isn't it? I was relying on that particular time to get to the Tuesday dominoes group.
