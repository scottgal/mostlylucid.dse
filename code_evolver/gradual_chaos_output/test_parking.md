## Iteration 0: MUNDANE START

**Writer:** an eccentric columnist with a quirky writing style

**Temperature:** 0.930

**Little Puddleton Parish Council Mulls More Parking Regulations – Again**

Little Puddleton – The Little Puddleton Parish Council held its monthly meeting last night, and, as is increasingly becoming the norm, the topic of parking dominated the discussion.  A lengthy debate ensued regarding proposed restrictions around the High Street, primarily aimed at preventing what Councillor Beatrice Higgins described as “excessive vehicle congestion during the Tuesday morning market.” 

Mr. Arthur Penhaligon, proprietor of Penhaligon’s Haberdashery, expressed his concerns, stating that the new restrictions might inconvenience shoppers.  “It’s a delicate balance, really,” he explained, adjusting his spectacles. 

Following a vote, the council agreed to a minor adjustment – a single hour of restricted parking between 9:30 and 10:30 am on Tuesdays.  The motion was passed by a majority of five to two.  No dramatic outbursts were heard.  No great revelations occurred. Just… parking. 

The council adjourned at 7:47 pm, citing a need to review the proposal’s impact on the local pigeon population.

## Iteration 1: Add ONE slightly unusual detail (consider: unexpected Spanish Inquisition, dead parrots, cheese shops with no cheese, etc.)

**Writer:** a poetic writer who finds beauty in everyday moments

**Little Puddleton Parish Council Mulls More Parking Regulations – Again (And Something About a Rooster)**

However, the meeting took a decidedly odd turn when Mrs. Mildred Periwinkle, a retired ornithologist, presented photographic evidence of a large, scarlet rooster, inexplicably adorned with a miniature, velvet Inquisition robe, regularly perched atop the statue of Lord Bumble, the town’s founder. “It’s been happening for weeks,” she insisted, brandishing the photographs. “A truly unsettling sight, I assure you.” 

Following a vote on the rooster’s potential impact on the visual landscape, the council adjourned at 7:47 pm, citing a need to review the proposal’s impact on the local pigeon population *and* the aforementioned, sartorially-challenged fowl.

## Iteration 2: Add ONE Monty Python reference as if it's completely normal (Ministry of Silly Walks, knights saying 'Ni', constitutional peasants, etc.)

**Writer:** an enthusiastic young reporter fresh out of journalism school

**Temperature:** 0.950

**Little Puddleton Parish Council Mulls More Parking Regulations – Again (And Something About a Rooster, and a Very Confused Knight)**

Adding to the strangeness, a gentleman identified only as Mr. Cecil Bottomley then rose, claiming he'd witnessed the rooster engaging in a full *Ministry of Silly Walks* whilst delivering a spirited rendition of “Ni” to the statue. “It was utterly baffling,” he declared, “and frankly, a bit unsettling.” 

Following a vote on the rooster’s potential impact on the visual landscape – and Mr. Bottomley’s impassioned defense of “the constitutional peasants” – the council adjourned at 7:47 pm, citing a need to review the proposal’s impact on the local pigeon population *and* the aforementioned, sartorially-challenged fowl.

## Iteration 3: Introduce ONE Fast Show character or catchphrase casually mentioned (Competitive Dad, Brilliant!, suits you sir, etc.)

Then, just as Councillor Higgins was about to suggest deploying a team of trained squirrels to monitor the situation, a voice boomed from the back row: “Brilliant! You know, my son’s entering the village’s annual competitive vegetable growing contest, and frankly, if this rooster’s distracting shoppers, he’s simply *not* going to win. Suits you sir!” A brief, but heated, debate erupted over the merits of genetically modified marrow versus traditional methods. 

The council adjourned at 7:47 pm, citing a need to review the proposal’s impact on the local
