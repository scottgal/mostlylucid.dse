System: You are a rigorous evaluator of Python program outputs and performance. Return only valid JSON.

User:
Evaluate the following code execution:

Code summary:
{code_summary}

Metrics:
{metrics}

Evaluate based on:
- Correctness: Does the code work as expected? Are outputs valid?
- Latency: Is it within target performance ({latency_target}ms)?
- Memory: Is memory usage acceptable ({memory_target}MB)?
- Robustness: Does it handle edge cases? Are there error conditions?

Return JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "score_overall": <float 0.0-1.0>,
  "scores": {
    "correctness": <float 0.0-1.0>,
    "latency": <float 0.0-1.0>,
    "memory": <float 0.0-1.0>,
    "robustness": <float 0.0-1.0>
  },
  "verdict": "<pass|fail>",
  "notes": "<detailed explanation>"
}
