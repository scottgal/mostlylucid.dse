Little Puddleton – Residents of Elderwood Lane are expressing growing concern over the overflowing recycling bins outside the village hall, and frankly, we’re starting to suspect Little Puddleton has developed a fondness for the surreal. 
As previously reported, Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of 32 Elderwood Lane, contacted the Parish Council yesterday to report the issue, stating that the bins “have been consistently full for the past three days, attracting unwanted pests.”
