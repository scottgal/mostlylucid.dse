**Little Puddleton Library’s Donations Continue to Bewilder – Clockwork Badger Now Attempts Shakespearean Monologues While Conducting a Miniature Orchestra**
Little Puddleton, Somerset – The Little Puddleton Village Library is rapidly establishing itself as a hub of the wonderfully weird this week, following a generous donation from local resident, Mr. Arthur Finch. The library, a vital resource for the community, has received over 150 books, a meticulously drawn full-scale map charting the territories of “The Whispering Woods,” approximately seventy-three perfectly polished acorn shells arranged in a spiral pattern, and a remarkably articulate toadstool, adorned with tiny silver bells, currently humming a melancholic sea shanty. 
Alongside these intriguing additions, Mr. Finch provided a remarkably precise, miniature clockwork badger, approximately six inches tall, which was currently attempting – and failing – to deliver a spirited rendition of Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy, complete with a tiny, disconcerting grin.
However, the surprises didn’t end there. Nestled amongst the badger and shells, library staff discovered a small, intricately crafted music box – a tiny, mahogany carousel, perpetually spinning and playing a disconcertingly jaunty polka tune. And, to compound the strangeness, the clockwork badger, seemingly inspired, began conducting the carousel with a miniature silver baton, occasionally pausing mid-soliloquy to give a dramatic flourish. 
“It seems to have a particular fondness for shanties,” Mrs. Higgins remarked, carefully noting the anomaly in her logbook. “We’re absolutely delighted,” she said, glancing nervously at the spinning carousel. “The books are a fantastic addition to our collection, particularly…” 
Library staff, headed by Mrs. Penelope Higgins, expressed their gratitude. “We’re absolutely delighted,” she said, “The books are a fantastic addition to our collection, particularly…”
