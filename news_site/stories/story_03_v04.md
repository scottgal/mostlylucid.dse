**Little Puddleton Library Receives Book Donation – And a Miniature, Clockwork Badger Obsessed with Performing Shakespeare**
Little Puddleton, Somerset – The Little Puddleton Village Library received a welcome boost this week with a donation of over 150 books from local resident, Mr. Arthur Finch. Mr. Finch, a retired accountant, stated he’d been “clearing out some old reading material” and felt the library – a vital resource for the community – would appreciate it. 
“It’s a lovely little place,” Mr. Finch commented. “I always enjoyed reading as a boy, and I thought these might be useful for the children.” Alongside the books, Mr. Finch presented a meticulously drawn, full-scale map charting the territories of “The Whispering Woods,” a realm populated entirely by fantastical beasts. 
Library staff, headed by Mrs. Penelope Higgins, expressed their gratitude. “We’re absolutely delighted,” she said. “The books are a fantastic addition to our collection, particularly a range of classic children’s stories. And, well, this… this is certainly… unique. We’re hoping this will encourage more young people to visit us – perhaps to consult the map!” 
Alongside the map, Mr. Finch also provided a collection of approximately seventy-three perfectly polished acorn shells, each arranged in a spiral pattern. “I found them particularly beautiful,” he explained simply. And, unexpectedly, a single, remarkably articulate toadstool, adorned with tiny silver bells, which was demonstrably humming a melancholic sea shanty. 
But the surprises didn’t end there. Nestled amongst the shells was a remarkably precise, miniature clockwork badger, approximately six inches tall, which was currently attempting – and failing – to deliver a spirited rendition of Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy, complete with a tiny, disconcerting grin. “It seems to have a particular fondness for shanties,” Mrs. Higgins remarked, carefully noting the anomaly in her logbook. “We’re absolutely delighted,” she said. “The books are a fantastic addition to our collection, particularly…”
