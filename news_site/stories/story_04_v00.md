**Autumnal Obstruction Causes Minor Traffic Delays in Little Puddleton**
Little Puddleton – Residents of Elm Street experienced minor delays this morning due to a significant accumulation of fallen autumn leaves clogging the village’s drainage gullies. Initial reports began circulating around 8:15 AM, with several motorists complaining of reduced visibility and, in one instance, a complete standstill at the junction of Elm and Willow Roads. 
The Little Puddleton Parish Council dispatched a single member, Mr. Arthur Finch, to manually clear the debris. “It’s a matter of routine, really,” Mr. Finch stated, pausing to brush a fleck of crimson leaf from his tweed jacket. “The trees are putting on a magnificent show, but the drainage needs attention. Happens every year.” 
Traffic resumed normal flow by approximately 9:30 AM. Residents are advised to exercise caution when driving through the affected area. The Parish Council will continue to monitor the situation and expects to conduct a more thorough clearing operation later this week, weather permitting.
