**Little Puddleton Bench’s Anomalies Multiply – Now Featuring a Singing Taxidermied Hedgehog**
LITTLE PUDDLETON – The quiet revelation surrounding the recently dedicated memorial bench in memory of Arthur Penhaligon continues to deepen, revealing a tapestry of bewildering detail. Yesterday’s unveiling, marked by Reverend Davies’ predictably earnest remarks on Mr. Penhaligon’s “quiet dedication,” was immediately followed by the discovery of the stone spiral, the meticulously charted squirrel census (totaling 37 individuals with estimated nut-hoarding capacities), the miniature weather vane perpetually pointing southwest, the persistent pigeon orchestra, the chronometric beehive tracking wind angles, and a self-composing sonnet collection. 
Today, however, the bench acquired a further, utterly perplexing addition: a porcelain teacup, seemingly constructed of solidified moonlight, which now occupies a prominent position beneath the sonnets. The teacup, identified only as “Celeste,” emits a low, humming vibration and occasionally rotates slowly, spilling a single, iridescent drop of liquid onto the first line of each newly composed verse. Adding to the already surreal spectacle, a small, intricately crafted clockwork moth, no larger than a thumb, has begun to emerge from the base of the bench, meticulously dusting the sonnets with a shimmering, silver powder. 
Furthermore, this morning, a taxidermied hedgehog, meticulously dressed in a miniature tweed waistcoat, was observed to be humming a complex fugue – allegedly in C minor – while simultaneously rearranging the pebbles in the stone spiral. Witnesses report the hedgehog, dubbed “Pipkin,” occasionally offers unsolicited philosophical observations regarding the nature of existence.  
“It’s… unsettlingly precise,” commented Mrs. Higgins, a regular visitor to the green. “The sonnets are beautiful, of course, but Celeste, the moth, Pipkin – it’s all utterly fascinating.” No one knows the origin of Celeste or the moth, though local folklore now whispers of Mr. Penhaligon’s peculiar habit of collecting “objects that held unspoken stories.” The bench, and indeed, Little Puddleton itself, has firmly entered a realm of profound, unnerving curiosity. Authorities are currently consulting with experts in lepidopteran mechanics, Victorian porcelain craftsmanship, and, curiously, miniature sartorial engineering.
