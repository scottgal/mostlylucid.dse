**New Bench Honored Former Councillor in Little Puddleton**
LITTLE PUDDLETON – A modest ceremony took place yesterday afternoon at the village green to formally dedicate a new memorial bench in memory of Arthur Penhaligon, former Little Puddleton Parish Councillor. The bench, a standard oak design sourced from Miller’s Timber Merchants, was officially unveiled by Reverend Davies, who delivered a brief, and frankly rather predictable, address on Mr. Penhaligon’s “quiet dedication” and “service to the community.” 
Approximately twenty residents, mostly retirees and members of the Little Puddleton Gardening Club, attended. Mrs. Higgins, a regular visitor to the green, commented that the bench “should be right.” 
Mr. Penhaligon, who served on the council for twenty years before stepping down last autumn, was described as “a reliable sort.” The bench is now situated near the rose bed, where, according to sources, Mrs. Penhaligon intends to spend most of her afternoons.  No further events are planned.
