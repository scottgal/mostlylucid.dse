**Little Puddleton –** Residents of Elm Street experienced minor delays this morning due to a significant accumulation of fallen autumn leaves clogging the village’s drainage gullies. Initial reports began circulating around 8:15 AM, with several motorists complaining of reduced visibility and, in one instance, a complete standstill at the junction of Elm and Willow Roads.
