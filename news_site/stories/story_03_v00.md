**Little Puddleton Library Receives Generous Book Donation**
Little Puddleton, Somerset – The Little Puddleton Village Library received a welcome boost this week with a donation of over 150 books from local resident, Mr. Arthur Finch. Mr. Finch, a retired accountant, stated he’d been “clearing out some old reading material” and felt the library – a vital resource for the community – would appreciate it. 
“It’s a lovely little place,” Mr. Finch commented. “I always enjoyed reading as a boy, and I thought these might be useful for the children.” 
Library staff, headed by Mrs. Penelope Higgins, expressed their gratitude. “We’re absolutely delighted,” she said. “The books are a fantastic addition to our collection, particularly a range of classic children’s stories. We’re hoping this will encourage more young people to visit us.” 
The donated books are currently being catalogued and will be available for borrowing from next week. The library is open Tuesday to Saturday, 10am to 4pm.
