**Bin Blues, Blue Jays, Buttons, and a Petrified Squirrel – Little Puddleton Residents Voice Concern Over Overflowing Recycling**
Little Puddleton – Residents of Elderwood Lane are expressing growing concern over the overflowing recycling bins outside the village hall. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of 32 Elderwood Lane, contacted the Parish Council yesterday to report the issue, stating that the bins “have been consistently full for the past three days, attracting unwanted pests.”
“It’s simply not acceptable,” Mr. Finch commented. “The smell is quite unpleasant, particularly with the recent rain.”

Adding to the strangeness, Mrs. Higgins also reported that a collection of mismatched, iridescent buttons – predominantly pearlescent and rose-coloured – had begun appearing amongst the plastic waste. “It’s quite baffling,” she stated. “They seem to multiply overnight. We suspect a mischievous magpie, but the sheer volume is…remarkable.” 
And, remarkably, this morning a single, perfectly formed, petrified squirrel was discovered nestled amongst the discarded packaging. Constable Davies, responding to a call from a concerned Mrs. Peterson, confirmed the find. “It’s a genuine enigma,” he stated. “The forensic team are examining it, but frankly, it looks like it just…appeared.”

Residents are advised to refrain from using the bins until the collection is complete. The Parish Council assures residents that efforts are being made to ensure a
