**Autumnal Obstruction and a Synchronized Squirrel Migration Cause Traffic Chaos in Little Puddleton**
Little Puddleton – Residents of Elm Street experienced minor delays this morning due to a significant accumulation of fallen autumn leaves clogging the village’s drainage gullies. Initial reports began circulating around 8:15 AM, with several motorists complaining of reduced visibility and, in one instance, a complete standstill at the junction of Elm and Willow Roads. 
The Little Puddleton Parish Council dispatched a single member, Mr. Arthur Finch, to manually clear the debris. “It’s a matter of routine, really,” Mr. Finch stated, pausing to brush a fleck of crimson leaf from his tweed jacket. “The trees are putting on a magnificent show, but the drainage needs attention. Happens every year.” However, the situation escalated when, approximately fifteen minutes later, a significant number of local squirrels – estimated at around sixty – began exhibiting a highly coordinated, almost rhythmic, movement around the affected area, seemingly mirroring Mr. Finch’s efforts to clear the leaves. 
Witnesses reported the squirrels were meticulously gathering the fallen foliage, stacking it into neat little pyramids, and even attempting to “direct” Mr. Finch's movements with insistent chattering. “It was utterly bizarre,” said local baker, Mrs. Higgins. “They were like tiny, furry construction workers!” 
Traffic resumed normal flow by approximately 9:30 AM, coinciding with the squirrels’ sudden dispersal. The Parish Council will continue to monitor the situation and expects to conduct a more thorough clearing operation later this week, weather permitting. Residents are advised to exercise caution when driving through the affected area – and perhaps keep an eye out for unusually organized rodent activity.
