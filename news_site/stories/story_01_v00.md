**Bin Blues in Little Puddleton – Resident Voices Concern Over Overflowing Recycling**
Little Puddleton – Residents of Elderwood Lane are expressing growing concern over the overflowing recycling bins outside the village hall. Mr. Arthur Finch, a resident of 32 Elderwood Lane, contacted the Parish Council yesterday to report the issue, stating that the bins “have been consistently full for the past three days, attracting unwanted pests.”
“It’s simply not acceptable,” Mr. Finch commented. “The smell is quite unpleasant, particularly with the recent rain.” 
Parish Council Clerk, Mrs. Beatrice Higgins, confirmed the issue is being addressed. “We’ve contacted the Waste Management Service and they are scheduled to collect an extra load of recycling this morning. We’ll also be monitoring the situation closely.” 
Residents are advised to refrain from using the bins until the collection is complete. The Parish Council assures residents that efforts are being made to ensure a smoother collection process moving forward. Further updates will be posted on the Little Puddleton website.
